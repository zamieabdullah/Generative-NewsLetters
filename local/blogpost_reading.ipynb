      "After a decade of relative stability in mortgage rates, the last few years have seen unprecedented volatility and changes in mortgage rates. Interest rates are often a key concern for real estate investors, as mortgages are often the difference between a cash-flowing deal and a dud.  \n",
      "Since spring 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest rate-hiking cycle, interest rates on the most popular loans for real estate investors, DSCR loans (part of the non-QM loans category), have moved at unprecedented rates. Many months of rates moving at most a few basis points a week morphed into dramatic, massive movements—with bigger changes sometimes happening in one day than had occurred in quarters or years prior.\n",
      "Real estate investors navigating the challenging market of 2024—with mortgage rates still at elevated levels—are at an advantage when they can lock in financing terms or plan purchases while DSCR loan rates are favorable. But figuring out what to look for and what moves mortgage markets can be challenging.  \n",
      "We’ll help pull back the curtain a bit on the biggest drivers of mortgage rates, as well as how investors can watch the market like a financial expert does.\n",
      "Bond Market Concepts: What Determines Mortgage Rates?\n",
      "In the United States in 2024, mortgage rates are generally tied to the overall bond market, as most residential mortgages, including conventional qualifying mortgages for owner-occupants, residential investment mortgages (DSCR loans), and even other alternative residential mortgages (non-QM), are securitized. This means they are bundled together and turned into bonds, financial instruments that pay out interest (yield) to investors looking for a steady, fixed return. These investors are typically large financial institutions looking for safe, predictable returns, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks.\n",
      "Key concepts to understand in economics and finance are risk and reward. Risk should be thought of neither as good nor bad, but rather always in relation to the associated reward or returns. \n",
      "For example, a 10% return (or reward) can be worth the risk if you are investing in a Class A single-family rental in a great market with an A+ tenant, but not worth the risk at all if betting on a 16-seed to make it to the Final Four in March Madness.\n",
      "Investors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.  \n",
      "When people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\n",
      "However, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.  \n",
      "One key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond. \n",
      "These mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\n",
      "Without delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.  \n",
      "This means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.  \n",
      "For DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\n",

      "Note on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\n",
      "Before diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.  \n",
      "Typically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else. \n",
      "This is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\n",
      "Key Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\n",
      "Here are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\n",
      "Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n",
      "For even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\n",
      "CPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\n",
      "Remember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.  You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.  \n",
      "If you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\n",
      "Jobs report\n",
      "Another key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\n",
      "In 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\n",
      "These reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\n",
      "Jobless claims\n",
      "While the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\n",
      "Producer Price Index (PPI)\n",
      "The Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\n",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\n",
      "The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report. \n",
      "While the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\n",
      "Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\n",
      "The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S. \n",
      "Like other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to. \n",
      "One recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade. \n",
      "The fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\n",
      "Fed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\n",
      "While Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\n",
      "However, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\n",
      "Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\n",
      "An additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\n",
      "University of Michigan Survey\n",
      "As inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\n",
      "Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\n",
      "Another factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen. \n",
      "One example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\n",
      "Auctions\n",
      "Large Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing. \n",
      "Unlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "While the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.  \n",
      "When will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\n",

      "When people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\n",
      "However, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.  \n",
      "One key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond. \n",
      "These mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\n",
      "Without delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.  \n",
      "This means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.  \n",
      "For DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\n",

      "Note on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\n",
      "Before diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.  \n",
      "Typically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else. \n",
      "This is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\n",
      "Key Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\n",
      "Here are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\n",
      "Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n",
      "For even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\n",
      "CPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\n",
      "Remember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.  You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.  \n",
      "If you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\n",
      "Jobs report\n",
      "Another key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\n",
      "In 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\n",
      "These reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\n",
      "Jobless claims\n",
      "While the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\n",
      "Producer Price Index (PPI)\n",
      "The Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\n",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\n",
      "The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report. \n",
      "While the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\n",
      "Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\n",
      "The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S. \n",
      "Like other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to. \n",
      "One recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade. \n",
      "The fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\n",
      "Fed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\n",
      "While Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\n",
      "However, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\n",
      "Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\n",
      "An additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\n",
      "University of Michigan Survey\n",
      "As inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\n",
      "Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\n",
      "Another factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen. \n",
      "One example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\n",
      "Auctions\n",
      "Large Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing. \n",
      "Unlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "While the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.  \n",
      "When will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\n",

      "We took the current value of all homes (as of April 2019) in the largest 50 metro areas and calculated the share affordable in each ZIP code to a would-be buyer that earns the local median income. Homes were considered affordable if 30% or less of the metro’s median monthly income was required to afford a mortgage payment and other expenses, including property taxes, on that home.\n",
      "In order to find the share of affordable homes on the market, we calculated the maximum amount that the median income could allocate towards a mortgage payment. We evaluated the value of each home, subtracted a 20% down payment and calculated the monthly mortgage payment using the prevailing 30-year fixed mortgage rate (according to Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey). We also factored in mortgage insurance and property taxes. Based on these calculations, we determined the share of homes that were affordable without exceeding 30% of the median monthly income for that metro. Median household income is based on the U.S. Census’ 2017 1-Year American Community Survey.\n",

      "{'title': 'What Are Current DSCR Loan Rates? Key Market Movers and How to Track Rates', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by\\xa0Easy Street Capital. Read our\\xa0editorial guidelines\\xa0for more information.\\nAfter a decade of relative stability in mortgage rates, the last few years have seen unprecedented volatility and changes in mortgage rates. Interest rates are often a key concern for real estate investors, as mortgages are often the difference between a cash-flowing deal and a dud.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince spring 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest rate-hiking cycle, interest rates on the most popular loans for real estate investors, DSCR loans (part of the non-QM loans category), have moved at unprecedented rates. Many months of rates moving at most a few basis points a week morphed into dramatic, massive movements—with bigger changes sometimes happening in one day than had occurred in quarters or years prior.\\nReal estate investors navigating the challenging market of 2024—with mortgage rates still at elevated levels—are at an advantage when they can lock in financing terms or plan purchases while DSCR loan rates are favorable. But figuring out what to look for and what moves mortgage markets can be challenging.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe’ll help pull back the curtain a bit on the biggest drivers of mortgage rates, as well as how investors can watch the market like a financial expert does.\\nBond Market Concepts: What Determines Mortgage Rates?\\nIn the United States in 2024, mortgage rates are generally tied to the overall bond market, as most residential mortgages, including conventional qualifying mortgages for owner-occupants, residential investment mortgages (DSCR loans), and even other alternative residential mortgages (non-QM), are securitized. This means they are bundled together and turned into bonds, financial instruments that pay out interest (yield) to investors looking for a steady, fixed return. These investors are typically large financial institutions looking for safe, predictable returns, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks.\\nKey concepts to understand in economics and finance are risk and reward. Risk should be thought of neither as good nor bad, but rather always in relation to the associated reward or returns.\\xa0\\nFor example, a 10% return (or reward) can be worth the risk if you are investing in a Class A single-family rental in a great market with an A+ tenant, but not worth the risk at all if betting on a 16-seed to make it to the Final Four in March Madness.\\nInvestors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\\nHowever, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond.\\xa0\\nThese mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\\nWithout delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\\nBefore diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else.\\xa0\\nThis is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\\nKey Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\\nHere are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\\nFor even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\\nCPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\\nRemember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.\\xa0\\xa0You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\\nJobs report\\nAnother key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\\nIn 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\\nThese reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\\nJobless claims\\nWhile the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\\nProducer Price Index (PPI)\\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report.\\xa0\\nWhile the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S.\\xa0\\nLike other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to.\\xa0\\nOne recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade.\\xa0\\nThe fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\\nFed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\\nWhile Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\\nHowever, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\\nAdditionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\\nAn additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\\nUniversity of Michigan Survey\\nAs inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\\nPurchasing Managers Index (PMI)\\nAnother factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen.\\xa0\\nOne example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\\nAuctions\\nLarge Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing.\\xa0\\nUnlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nWhile the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\\nFollow the author of this article, Easy Street Capital Partner Robin Simon, on multiple social platforms, including X and BiggerPockets, for daily market insights as well!\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by Easy Street Capital\\n\\nEasy Street Capital is a private real estate lender headquartered in Austin, Texas, serving real estate investors around the country.

      "{'title': 'How to Collect Rent from Tenants: The Landlord’s Ultimate Guide to Rent Collection', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nOnline rent collection is more efficient than traditional methods.Clear communication with tenants is key for on-time payments.Strategies like screening, incentives, and apps help ensure timely rent. \\n\\nCollecting rent on time from tenants is the biggest pain point for most landlords. Late rent payments disrupt your cash flow and cause unnecessary stress. You may also struggle to cover mortgage payments and pay bills when rent doesn’t come in on time.\\xa0\\nThe solution? Know how to collect rent from tenants on time every month. This ensures healthy cash flow and boosts your bottom line.\\nRent collection should never be a game of “catch me if you can.” After all, chasing tenants for late rent is never as much fun as chasing after Fido, who’s run off with your prized possession. Tenants need proper training to deliver rent on time. And training starts with implementing the correct methods and tools to collect rent every month.\\nWhat are the best ways to optimize the rent collection process and avoid late or missed payments? We’ll examine the best methods to collect rent and discuss traditional ways of collecting rent versus online rent payments. In the end, you can decide on the best solution for you and your tenants.\\nTenant Rent Collection Methods: Traditional vs. Online\\nYour chosen payment method significantly impacts efficient rent collection. Many landlords still rely on paper checks, whereas there is a growing shift toward using online platforms or ACH bank transfers. Let’s compare these methods to find out how to collect rent from tenants on time.\\nTraditional methods\\nTraditional methods for collecting rent are cash or a paper check. What are the pros and cons of these methods?\\n\\nPhysical checks: The most common method is for tenants to mail rent checks. This is convenient for them, and the check is delivered to you. However, this process can become time-consuming if you have several rental properties. For example, you must drive to the bank, deposit the money, and wait for the checks to clear. Then you deal with bounced checks and the old excuse of “The check is in the mail, it must be lost.”\\nIn-person rent collection: Collecting cash in person is not an acceptable payment method. There are several reasons why. First, you should never collect cash payments because it’s unsafe. Second, you put yourself in the “chasing rent” category. Third, it’s ineffective and wastes your precious time.\\nTenants drop rent off at your home: Collecting rent in person at home is another big no-no. Giving out your home address to tenants is never a good idea. Do you really want an angry tenant showing up on your doorstep because you sent a late rent notice? Remember, you’re running a rental property business, not a hobby. So, try to keep your business and personal life as separate as possible.\\n\\nIn summary, while traditional rent collection methods like physical checks may be convenient, they also have several drawbacks. They are inefficient for timely rent collection, especially when modern methods exist.\\nOnline rent collection\\nSeveral online payment solutions can help ensure consistent rent collection. These methods range from online banking transfers to money transfer apps and dedicated rent collection platforms.\\nLet’s look at the best online rent collection systems to streamline your rental business and ensure a steady income from your properties.\\n\\nACH payments: This system simplifies the rent collection process. You no longer must process physical checks or cash. Also, automatic payments reduce the administrative burden for you and your tenants. However, it’s a good idea to check out bank fees for setting up and accepting ACH transfers.\\nDirect deposit: Getting tenants to set up direct deposit can help ensure regular rental income. A direct deposit is a form of ACH transfer where the money arrives directly in your bank account. While direct deposits are free for the sender (tenant), you may have to pay transaction fees to receive the money.\\nOnline rent payment platforms: One of the best ways to collect rent is to use a rent payment app. In many cases, these rent collection platforms do more than facilitate rental payments. They often include late payment fee collection, handling maintenance requests, managing security deposits, and reporting rent payment history to credit bureaus.\\nPayNearMe: Tenants who don’t have a bank account can use PayNearMe to pay monthly rent in cash. They use their unique card to pay at a local ACE Cash Express, 7-Eleven, or similar vendor. The tenant receives proof of payment, and you get instant notification of money in your bank account. This method to collect rent is free for landlords and costs tenants a small fee.\\nCash apps: Money transfer apps like PayPal, Wise, Venmo, Apple Pay, or Zelle are convenient ways to send and receive money. But are they a way to collect rent from tenants? These peer-to-peer payment services are not the best options for rental property owners. For example, you cannot block partial payments during an eviction process. Also, transaction fees can be costly if you have many rental properties.\\n\\nOnline rent collection is convenient and efficient, making it popular among landlords. However, not every option will work for you, depending on your business and tenants. Therefore, you must decide which is the most suitable to ensure efficient rent collection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich Rent Collection Method to Choose?\\nKnowing how to collect rent efficiently requires balancing convenience and efficiency for you and your tenants. Tenants may prefer sending rent by mail because it’s easier for them. On the other hand, online payment collection methods are quick, convenient, and secure.\\nHere’s a comparison of the various rent collection methods.\\nMethodCost*\\xa0SecureConvenience*Recurring payments?Automaticlate fees?Instant notifications?Block partialpayments?Report tocredit bureaus?Propertymanagement?Paper checksFreeModerateModerateNoNoNoYesNoNoIn-person collectionTravel to propertiesLowLowNoNoNoYesNoNoACH payments/direct depositLow feesYesHighYesNoYesYesNoNoRent payment appsLow feesYesHighYesYesYesYesYesYesCash appsLow feesYesModerateNoNoYesNoNoNoPayNearMeNoneHighHighNoNoYesNoNoNo\\n* The cost and convenience are from the landlord’s perspective.\\xa0You might also likeLandlording & Property ManagementA Landlord’s Guide to Legally Breaking a LeaseLandlording & Property ManagementHow to Market Your Rental Property (8 Tips for Landlords)Landlording & Property ManagementHow to Show a Rental Property (6 Simple Steps)Landlording & Property ManagementLandlord Guide to Rental Property Emergency Repairs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Concerns About Collecting Rent From Tenants\\nSwitching to online rent collection methods can raise concerns for landlords. For example, you may worry about security, handling late payments, and compliance with local and state rental laws. Additionally, you may need to convince tenants to switch to an online rent payment service.\\nLet’s address common concerns about how to collect rent from tenants using modern methods.\\nSecurity and privacy\\nEnsuring the privacy and security of tenants’ personal and financial information is vital. As a landlord, you must adopt securely encrypted payment methods and adhere to data protection regulations to prevent fraud and identity theft.\\nThe good news is that online payment platforms offer robust security measures. These platforms use encryption technology to protect sensitive information like bank account numbers and credit card details. They also adhere to industry regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).\\nGetting tenants on board\\nOne of the biggest challenges is convincing tenants to switch to an online rent payment system. Tenants may be hesitant to start using a system they’re unfamiliar with. Also, as of 2022, reports indicate that 58% of the 24 million offline households don’t see the need to be online, and 18% of these say they cannot afford a home internet service.\\nClear communication about the benefits of paying rent online is critical to make the transition. Explain its convenience, like recurring payments, proof of payment, and rent payment history, as well as no more paper checks getting lost in the mail or ending up in the wrong hands.\\nIntegration with accounting systems\\nRent collection software often features seamless integration with accounting systems. Think of how much time you save on lodging paper checks. Not only does this cut down on administrative work, but it also minimizes the risk of errors.\\nHandling late payments\\nAny landlord knows that late payments disrupt cash flow and add stress. What can you do if your tenant misses a rent payment?\\nEffective communication is crucial in resolving disputes. Therefore, try to understand why the rent is late. However, you must also understand local landlord-tenant laws and check the lease agreement to take appropriate action.\\nIn most cases, you should charge late rent fees. Of course, this may sound callous if the tenant is facing a temporary hardship. But it will help to ensure on-time rent payments in the future.\\nHere are a few tips on resolving issues with late payment of rent:\\n\\nHave a clear late fee policy in the rental agreement.\\nEncourage the tenant to borrow money or use a credit card to pay rent.\\nOffer a partial payment agreement if appropriate.\\n\\nPayment verification\\nOnline payments resolve the problems of payment tracking and verification. We all know that processing paper checks is time-consuming and cumbersome. Also, the tenant doesn’t know when or if you receive their check in the mail. This process can lead to misunderstandings and late rent notices.\\nOnline rent payment systems benefit both the tenant and landlord, as both parties can quickly and easily view payment records, ensuring the rent is paid on time.\\nFees and costs\\nManaging the costs associated with different payment methods can be a concern. Tenants may refuse to use a payment system that incurs extra transaction fees. Additionally, some online payment portals make it free to send money, but charge fees on receipt.\\nTherefore, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various payment options is wise to ensure they don’t impact your rental income.\\nCompliance with laws\\nNavigating local, state, and federal laws can be a nightmare for anyone running a rental business. So it’s vital to keep up to date on regulations regarding rent collection, late fees, and eviction processes. Also, going online means complying with data protection laws and ensuring your systems are secure.\\nSuccessful landlords realize the importance of hiring a lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law. Additionally, digital payments and electronic file storage are safer than traditional methods if you have the proper security measures.\\nTips for Encouraging On-Time Rent Payments\\nRegular rental income is your bread and butter, so ensuring you collect rent from all tenants every month is crucial to your bottom line. What are the best ways to ensure timely rent payments and maintain a successful rental business?\\nLet’s examine a few ways to keep your rental cash flow healthy.\\nClear communication\\nFirst, you must have a clear, unambiguous rent collection policy in the lease agreement. Terms of the lease agreement regarding rent payments should include:\\n\\nThe monthly rent amount\\nRent due day\\nApproved payment methods\\nGrace period for late rent payments (check local rental laws)\\nLate fee policy\\nRent increases\\n\\nBefore you draft the lease agreement, have a real estate attorney check it for compliance with local, state, and federal laws.\\nTenant screening\\nTenant screening is critical to ensuring on-time rent payments. Remember, letting a tenant into your rental property is easy, but it’s much harder to get them out, even if they stop paying rent. Therefore, due diligence is crucial when screening tenants.\\nEssential points in the screening process include:\\n\\nEmployment history\\nRental background check, including previous evictions\\nCredit history\\nIncome at least three times the rent price\\n\\nSend reminders to tenants\\nLet’s face it: We’re all busy—including your tenants. So, a gentle reminder that rent day is approaching can help minimize late payments. You can set up automated emails or SMS messages or use the function in a rent payment app.\\nOffer incentives for on-time rent payments\\nEncourage tenants to make on-time payments by offering incentives. Here are a few ideas:\\n\\nOffer tenants a discount for punctual rent payments for a certain number of months.\\nKnock $20 off the rental price when they pay before the due date.\\nSet aside $5 each month when they pay rent on time, and reward them with a gift card when they renew their lease.\\n\\nSet up automatic rent payments\\nEncourage tenants to set up recurring monthly payments through their bank or a rent collection platform. Automatic payments ensure you can collect rent every month without reminding the tenant.\\nCredit reporting to encourage tenants to pay rent on time\\nOffering to report on-time rent payments to credit bureaus is an excellent way to encourage on-time payments. This incentive benefits tenants who want to build their credit history. It can also incentivize them to switch to an online rent payment app.\\nEnforce late fees\\nCharging late fees per the rental agreement is always a good idea. Although it may be tempting to waive the fees, you risk allowing bad habits to develop. Also, if you waive the fees for one tenant, you may have to waive them for all the tenants in a multifamily property.\\nOf course, individual tenants may have extenuating circumstances. If they are excellent tenants who always pay on time, you may decide to cancel the late fee.\\nOffer flexible payment options\\nThe traditional method of collecting rent on the first of the month may not work for all tenants. Many self-employed people work in the gig economy and don’t receive wages on a specific day. So, offering to split rent payments into two or three installments a month may help you collect rent regularly with no late payments.\\nOffer multiple payment options\\nStatistics show that consumers are shifting to faster electronic payment methods. Therefore, offering options to pay rent by credit or debit card can boost on-time rent payments. This option can allow tenants to reap the benefits of credit card payments such as cash back, reward points, and bonuses.\\nPartial rent payments\\nUnfortunately, some good tenants get into temporary financial difficulty. Rather than serve an eviction notice, you could work out a mutually agreeable payment plan. This option could allow tenants to get back on their feet while you avoid a costly eviction process.\\nOffering partial rent payments isn’t suitable for every tenant, but it can help you keep good tenants experiencing short-term cash flow issues. As always, put everything in writing to communicate the terms for paying rent over an extended period.\\nUse a rent collection app\\nProperty management software can streamline the rent collection process. Chances are that most of your tenants already use smartphones. A rent payment app has features like automatic payments, instant notifications, and easy payment tracking, making collecting rent from tenants on time easier.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLearning the art of rent collection is crucial for running a successful rental business. Implementing efficient, effective rent collection strategies can minimize stress, improve cash flow, and help maintain a positive relationship with your tenants.\\nSwitching to online payment systems helps streamline the rent payment and collection process. To simplify the process, use clear communication, incentives, rent reminder emails, and recurring rent payments. This way, you can effectively collect rent from tenants on time every month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSave time and money with this refreshing guide to managing your own properties.\\nIn The Self-Managing Landlord, Amelia McGee and Grace Gudenkauf share the secrets of efficient property management, tenant screening and onboarding, and scaling your business—all to help you break free from the 9-to-5 grind and create lasting wealth through real estate.\\n\\nGet Your Copy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote By BiggerPockets: These are opinions written by the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of BiggerPockets.\\n\\n'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Texas Has Some of the Fastest-Growing Cities in the United States—Should You Invest Before It’s Too Late?', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nAccording to the latest U.S. Census data, between July 2022 and July 2023, eight of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the United States were located in Texas.Texan cities routinely top the charts on its ability to cash flow. McAllen, Odessa, Corpus Christi, and El Paso made BiggerPockets' Top 10 Cash Flow Markets in 2024.But, rising property taxes, insurance, and overheated markets might give an investor pause when investing in Texas. \\n\\nEverything is bigger in Texas—including the growth of some of its most under-the-radar cities. According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures, between July 2022 and July 2023, eight of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the nation were in Texas.\\nThe unassuming Dallas suburb of Celina saw meteoric growth of 26.6%, more than 53 times the nation’s average growth rate of 0.5%. Following Celina were several smaller, less well-known Texas towns:\\xa0\\n\\nFulshear: 25.6% increase\\nPrinceton: 22.3% increase\\nAnna: 16.9% increase\\nGeorgetown: 10.6% increase\\nProsper: 10.5% increase\\nForney: 10.4% increase\\nKyle: 9% increase\\xa0\\n\\nLarger Texas towns fared well, too. Houston is currently the fourth-largest U.S. city, gaining on third-place Chicago.\\nWhy Texas?\\nFavorable taxes, jobs, lower-priced housing, a warm climate, and high-quality living have all driven the population surge from colder, high-priced Northern cities. However, the dramatic population increase in smaller towns might be more straightforward than that.\\xa0\\n“The list of fastest-growing cities includes a lot of smaller cities that are not likely to be on many people’s radar,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, in a press release. “Smaller areas often top these lists because their smaller size makes it easier for them to see large percent changes.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Affordable Are the Top Small Towns in Texas?\\nAccording to Realtor.com data, affordability isn’t always at the top of the list when choosing a place to live. Celina’s median home price of $679,999 is way above the national average. Rather, it’s coveted for its good schools and low crime rate. The hour-long commute to Dallas is also a plus.\\xa0\\nSimilarly, Fulshear, also high on the list, has a median home price of $519,000 and is only an hour away from Houston.\\nTexas Cash Flows, Too\\nWhile some of the fastest-growing cities in Texas comprised pricey single-family homes, less expensive housing in the state also dominates the country’s cash flow markets, too. Texas occupied six of the 10 most cash-flowing markets in the U.S., according to BiggerPockets data.\\nWhy Southern Texas is a Great Place to Invest\\nMcAllen, Texas, has been an investor favorite for years. According to BiggerPockets data, the city has a rent-to-price ratio of 0.84%, a median “owner-occupied” sales price of under $100,000, and a median rent price of around $800. Low-cost housing and rents mean that many investors can scale quickly.\\xa0\\nAlthough Realtor.com data tells a slightly different story, with the median home price sold being $285,300, this is likely due to the vast spread of house prices between lower and higher in the city, which offers multiple types of employment, from consulting services, financial services, medical, and education. Homes valued at around $150,000 in 2023 experienced an 80% increase in market value over the preceding five years. Other areas saw prices increase by over 100% in the same period as residents from California and elsewhere relocated during the pandemic amid the remote working boom.\\nBiggerPockets data reveals that the other southern Texas cities of Odessa, Corpus Christi, and El Paso also dominate the highest cash flow cities in the country due to affordability. The border towns and Gulf areas offer multiple types of employment, from military bases to medical, e-commerce fulfillment centers, food processing, and energy. In an age of high interest rates, these affordable Texan towns with robust employment make them great places to invest, either as an all-cash buyer or with a larger down payment, to refinance once rates fall.\\nBeware of Rising Property Taxes\\nThough many parts of Texas offer affordable housing, pricier cities that have appreciated significantly in recent years have seen property taxes soar, making them some of the most expensive in the country.\\xa0\\nAccording to a recent analysis by Axios, median property taxes on Texas single-family homes grew by 26% between 2019 and 2023 without accounting for inflation. Lawmakers have been trying to stem the increases and have had some success. Many property owners across the state saw their taxes fall by 28% in 2023.\\n“The bottom line is that it’s a much more taxpayer-friendly environment, particularly for homeowners, than it was before 2019, and even more so after last year’s increase in the homestead exemption,” Lynn Krebs, a research economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University, told Texastribune.org. Before the cuts, some residents saw their tax bill increase by as much as 31% between 2018 and 2023.You might also likeHousing MarketsThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate—and Lessons From ItHousing MarketsMalta is a Hot, Stunning Island Market in Europe—Here’s How to Invest ThereHousing MarketsFlorida Is the Perfect Rent-to-Own Market—Should You Take Advantage?Housing MarketsThese U.S. Cities Are Overflowing with Affordable Single-Family Homes Under $300k\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe issue of property taxes is contentious. Dispensing with taxes that would otherwise have been used for school district maintenance is a tough sell beyond what has already been achieved. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told the Texas Public Policy Foundation last year that the state would need approximately $55 billion to offset the cost of school district maintenance for 2024-2025, amounting to almost two-fifths of the state’s $144.1 billion general fund budget.\\nShould taxes continue to increase without the relief of lower interest rates, investors would need to look closely at their bottom-line cash flow numbers and choose to invest with large down payments or as all-cash buyers. Those who invested over a decade ago have enjoyed some golden years in appreciation and cash flow.\\xa0\\nHowever, that doesn’t mean another halcyon era of Texas investing doesn’t lie ahead. With businesses relocating and cities attracting new residents, Texas remains a great place to deploy your cash. However, unless you’re ready to put down a large amount of money, look at least for appreciation rather than cash flow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Why Successful Real Estate Investing Is All About Finding the Right Deal', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nFinding deals is one of the biggest barriers to entry in becoming a successful real estate investor.A good deal with a favorable equity spread helps mitigate risk from unknown scenarios and market fluctuations.Once you find a good deal, it's easier to pivot to other strategies when you exit your investment. \\n\\nAs you start to explore real estate investing, one of the first things you’ll hear about is the importance of finding deals. It’s a topic that dominates articles, BiggerPockets forum posts, YouTube videos, and conversations within the industry—and for good reason. Finding deals is the lifeblood of real estate investing.\\xa0\\nHere are four key reasons why a successful real estate investor focuses so much on finding the deal.\\n1. It Solves the Biggest Problem Investors Face\\nThe No. 1 reason why real estate investors are all about finding deals is that it’s the biggest challenge they face. No matter who they are, every real estate investor encounters this problem at some point. It’s one of the biggest barriers to entry in becoming a successful real estate investor.\\xa0\\nThink about the most successful businesses in the world: They found a problem that most of their audience faces and then provided a solution. If you can solve the problem of finding deals, you can essentially make money for as long as you want.\\nSolving this core need is beneficial not only for you but also for those around you. A good deal is essentially making money in real estate. You often hear the phrase, “We make money on the buy, not on the sell.” This directly points to your ability to find good deals.\\xa0\\nIf you can buy a deal properly, you’ve positioned yourself to make money. Successful real estate investors either have solved this problem or are actively working on it. As technology evolves, new opportunities for finding deals emerge, and the market shifts, requiring investors to stay on top of their game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. It’s the Best Protection Strategy\\nInvesting in any asset, whether it’s the stock market, cryptocurrency, or real estate, involves risk. The most successful real estate investors are those best prepared for these risks and who position themselves to mitigate them as much as possible. The better you mitigate risk, the more profitable you’ll be.\\nWhen it comes to real estate, buying a deal with a good equity spread is the best protection against many risks. Overpaying for a property means there’s no equity in the deal, which can lead to various problems. If the market shifts and property values drop, having a property with a good amount of equity protects you. Even if values decrease, you’re still into the property for less than it’s worth, giving you options to sell or rent without taking a loss.\\n3. It’s the Lowest Common Denominator Among All Exit Strategies\\nAll exit strategies—flipping houses, long-term rentals, mid-term rentals, short-term rentals, and wholesaling—require one thing: a good deal. If you focus on finding good deals, you can pivot among different strategies as needed, whether you’re flipping, renting, or wholesaling.\\nBuying a good deal means you can monetize the property in whatever way makes sense for you. If you want to be a landlord, you need a property that will cash flow. If you want to flip, you need a deal with enough spread to make a profit.\\xa0\\nThe common denominator for any successful strategy is buying a good deal.You might also likeFinding DealsFrom a Panic Attack To My First Deal in Just 90 Days: How I Mastered Real Estate Deal FindingFinding DealsHow Our Deal Broke Down at the Last Minute—And Why I’m Happy About ItFinding DealsSix Sources of Deals That Investors and Agents Can Capitalize on in Any MarketFinding DealsHow to Navigate Today’s Real Estate Market—Top Tips From Three Expert Investors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. It’s the Trigger Point for Everything Else in Real Estate Investing\\nFinding a good deal is the trigger point that makes everything else in real estate investing relevant. To purchase property, renovate it, and rent it out, you need connections—financing, contractors, and title companies. But having a good deal makes lining up these connections easier.\\nWithout a deal, getting banks to discuss loan products, contractors to provide bids, or title companies to assist is challenging. However, when you have a good deal, banks, contractors, and title companies are more willing to work with you. A good deal gives you leverage to get everything else in place.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nSuccessful real estate investors focus on finding the deal because it’s the biggest problem new investors face, the best protection strategy, the lowest common denominator for any exit strategy, and the trigger point that makes everything else easier.\\xa0\\nI hope this helps.

      "{'title': 'The Real Impact of 0% Down Mortgages and How an Investor Could Use One…or Not', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaise your hand if you got burned by real estate in 2008. You can’t see it, but I’m raising my hands, feet, and even the hairs on my neck.\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) recently made news by launching a 0%-down mortgage program. And it reminds many real estate analysts of the subprime mortgage frenzy that helped fuel the market collapse back in 2008.\\xa0\\nSo, as you scope out the new program, what’s the potential impact on real estate investors?\\xa0\\nA Summary of UWM’s 0%-Down Program\\nFirst, let’s start with the facts. The program allows lower-income first-time borrowers—those earning a household income below 80% of the local median household income—to borrow up to 97% of the purchase price. The remaining 3%, or what would ordinarily be the down payment, UWM covers with an interest-free second mortgage.\\xa0\\nBorrowers don’t make monthly payments against the second mortgage. When they sell or refinance the property, they must repay both the first and second mortgages in full.\\xa0\\nThis sounds like an awesome deal for the borrower. All things being equal, I’d take that deal as a borrower. Who doesn’t love interest-free financing?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat About House Hacking?\\nThe first thought that popped into my head when BiggerPockets asked me for my thoughts on how this loan program might impact investors was, “Wow, that’d be great for house hacking.”\\nIf you could buy a duplex, triplex, or fourplex with no money down and have it cash flow enough to cover your mortgage payment, you immediately step into free housing and a property that appreciates over time. And your mortgage payment stays fixed even as rents rise year after year, growing your cash flow over time.\\xa0\\nAfter a year of living in the property to fulfill the owner occupancy requirements, you could then use the money you saved on housing payments to buy another multifamily to house hack. You couldn’t use the UWM program a second time, but you could use Fannie Mae’s or Freddie Mac’s 3% down program or put down 3.5% on an FHA loan. And you would no longer be confined by the income limit at that point.\\xa0\\nEven so, that income limit would disqualify many, even most would-be house hackers. Food for thought.\\xa0\\nRisks and Impacts of 0% Down Mortgage Programs\\nI see a few risks with these kinds of programs, as well as their impacts on a few different groups. Here’s a look at them.\\nRisk of inflated home prices and bubbles\\nFor many would-be homeowners, the down payment creates the main barrier to entry. Remove that barrier, and you suddenly have an influx of new buyers on the market. This drives up home prices and adds to the possibility of a housing bubble.\\xa0\\nAll market bubbles burst sooner or later. And it wouldn’t even require a bubble or a housing market correction to put a lot of homeowners underwater.\\nRisk of underwater homes\\nIn this case, home prices dipping even 3% would put these homeowners underwater on their mortgage. And that says nothing of all the closing costs involved in selling a home.\\xa0\\nThey would be unable to sell, at least not without coming out of pocket with tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. This seems awfully unlikely for the low-income borrowers this program is designed to serve.\\xa0\\nThat sets the stage for strategic defaults and foreclosures—or, at the very least, short sales negotiated with lenders. These lenders may struggle to accommodate them in a down market.You might also likeOpinionThe Government Has Taken a Permanent Intellectual Vacation—This New Plan is Evident of ThatOpinionThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate—and Lessons From ItOpinionNo, Cash is Not King—You Can Do Way More and Way Better With FinancingOpinionBrian Took the Easy Way Out—Here’s Why He Made a Big Mistake and Why I’m Never Selling My Properties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk of credit crunches and lender failures\\nIf too many loans default or require short sales, lenders go into crisis mode. They tighten their lending standards or stop lending altogether.\\xa0\\nSome may even fold. We saw two regional banks fail in early 2023 due to commercial real estate exposure and far tighter lending standards in the industry after that.\\xa0\\nFinally, these loans get packaged and sold as securities. So, who ultimately takes many of the losses on them? You, me, pension funds, and other retail investors who have money tied up in these publicly traded funds and securities.\\xa0\\nImpact on note and debt investors\\nOver the last two years, secured notes and debts have actually performed pretty well. We’ve seen strong returns on the ones we’ve gone in on together in our passive real estate investment club at SparkRental.\\nBut imagine a housing bubble forms, or at the very least, the market dips by 5% to 10% nationwide. Hard money lenders, private debt funds, and others offering secured debts will see their non-performing loans skyrocket and, therefore, their losses. That would be bad news for people like me who invest passively in debts secured by real estate.\\xa0\\nImpact on private equity real estate investors\\nIn our Co-Investing Club, we primarily go in on real estate syndications together.\\xa0\\nA 2008-style housing-induced recession would drive up unemployment, which would, in turn, drive up rent defaults, evictions, and household bundling—all bad news.\\xa0\\nOne mitigating factor, if you want to call it that, is that some homeowners would become renters again, fueling demand for rental housing. But that’s cold comfort for everyone involved.\\xa0\\nOn the other end of the possibility spectrum, let’s say the program does exactly what it aims to do: put homeownership within reach for millions of renters. They all leave the pool of renters and become homeowners, crushing demand for rental housing.\\xa0\\nThat’s hardly good news for passive investors in multifamily real estate syndications.\\xa0\\nActivists Want It Both Ways\\nWe’ve all heard housing activists demand better access to homeownership for low-income families. I’m not opposed to that. I can’t think of anyone who is.\\xa0\\nBut here’s the problem: Read any article about the launch of UWM’s 0%-down loan program, and you’ll see quotes from those same housing activists warning about “setting buyers up for failure,” or “ticking time bombs,” or “the subprime nightmare all over again.”\\nGuess what? Subprime mortgages were created at the request of those same housing activists, who demanded more credit accessibility for low-income borrowers. They wanted fewer barriers to entry.\\xa0\\nThose barriers to entry keep the system stable. They ensure a minimum level of financial security among borrowers.\\xa0\\nSo which is it? Do you want homeownership more accessible, or less? You can’t have it both ways.\\xa0\\nWhat About Investors?\\nAs for real estate investors, just keep an eye on real estate market fundamentals. Watch out for frothiness. And when in doubt, invest more conservatively. Our No. 1 goal when we look at deals today as an investment club is protecting against downside risks.\\xa0\\nWe like investments that can weather some choppiness in the market—and you should, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Zero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage launched a new zero-down mortgage program available for first-time homebuyers.The program allows borrowers who qualify to get a mortgage and a second loan to cover the cost of the down payment up to $15,000.\\xa0While a few of these programs exist in different formats, critics warn that it could be the beginning of another housing crisis similar to 2008. \\n\\nWith housing prices and mortgage rates rising, it’s becoming harder for the average person to own a home, let alone invest in a second property. One mortgage lender has introduced a 0% down program in the hopes of attracting more buyers. While some critics are worried it’s similar to the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial crash, others say it’s nothing new.\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) announced its zero-down program in May. This program allows borrowers who qualify to get a mortgage and a second loan to cover the cost of the down payment. Borrowers can get a 3% down payment assistance loan of up to $15,000.\\xa0\\nThis second loan will not accrue interest or have a monthly payment. Instead, the loan has to be paid back in full if the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off, or the borrower refinances.\\nHomebuyers who want to take advantage of this program will need to be at or below 80% of the property address’s area median income or be a first-time buyer.\\nIs This a Repeat of the 2008 Housing Crisis?\\nWhile UWM says no other wholesale lender is offering this type of program nationally, programs have been in place for years that assist buyers with low or no down payments, such as bond programs, housing authority assistance on a local level, and veteran loans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also offers zero-down home loans in some rural areas, while Bank of America launched a zero-down mortgage program in 2022 for some Black and Hispanic communities.\\nStill, only a few of these programs exist, and they have many more controls that were set in place after the financial crisis. Lenders can no longer provide 100% financing on stated income, Lindsey Harn, a real estate agent in California, told BiggerPockets. “There is oversight on the financing, which far exceeds previous efforts,” she said. “Lenders and banks are held to strict ‘ability to repay’ guidelines, which hold them accountable to ensuring that a borrower has the stability and means to meet their debt obligations.”\\nJosh Brotemarkle, president and general counsel at Centra Capital Partners, told BiggerPockets that the real estate boom seen during the early 2000s was partly fueled by interest-only mortgages, which, like zero-down mortgages, assume that real estate will appreciate in value. But real estate can depreciate, and people are likely to walk away if they owe more than the home is valued at.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile zero-down mortgages can help homebuyers purchase a new home, these programs are not without risk, he added.\\n“The price to pay for programs that seek to curtail traditional lending practices is paid with a currency called ‘moral hazard,’” Brotemarkle explained. “Moral hazard occurs when people act in risky ways because they do not bear the full consequence of their actions. When borrowers are not at risk, they are less likely to care.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan Investors Benefit From Zero-Down Mortgages?\\nUWM’s zero-down program is aimed at homebuyers struggling to purchase a property, but that doesn’t mean investors can’t take advantage to buy a second property, provided they meet the requirements. Other zero-down programs could also be worth looking into, although their strict eligibility requirements and income requirements often mean that very few real estate investors qualify.\\xa0\\nA down payment is one of the biggest barriers to real estate investing, and these loan products can help a lot of people build their wealth, Nicholas Ritacco, portfolio manager and director at IB Global, told BiggerPockets. “If investors can find options that work for them, I believe they have to do so with the right plan,” he added.\\nStill, many real estate experts say a zero-down mortgage might not make investment sense, as not putting any money down means you are starting out with little equity. One of the biggest risks is that these programs offer very high loan-to-value loans and are essentially all debt, said Ritacco. It also doesn’t allow investors to refinance with an option to cash out.\\nHarn agreed, as zero-down programs “are too restrictive in rate to make sense as a business model.”\\n“A sufficient down payment and reserves should be used to ensure a property can adequately cover its debt service,” she added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Houston is the most at risk southern city.Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, says the key is knowing exactly what your insurance policy covers and mitigating your risks based on that. \\n\\n\\nHurricane season has started, and forecasts are not looking good. According to analytics company CoreLogic, more than 32.7 million homes from Texas to Maine are at risk of hurricane damage this year.\\nThe season is expected to be very busy and possibly top the record books for the number of storms named. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts there could be as many as 25 total storms, with eight to 13 becoming hurricanes.\\nExperts say the ocean is warming around the world. At the same time, the end of one of the strongest El Ninos ever observed could quickly transition to a La Nina, which generally causes more hurricanes over the Atlantic. The combination of warm weather and high winds could mean the perfect recipe for stronger storms this season.\\xa0\\nMetro Areas Most at Risk of Hurricane and Storm Surges\\nWhile it’s impossible to know exactly who will be impacted this hurricane season, some areas could be harder hit than others, while not all homes will experience a total loss. Some could be damaged by flooding and storm surges, and others by wind.\\nCoreLogic’s 2024 Hurricane Risk Report identified the areas most at risk of damage from hurricane winds and storm surges. Areas with high population density in low-lying coastal areas are most at risk. However, how much a property could be damaged depends on various factors, such as elevation changes and any barriers to block water from moving inland.\\xa0\\nHere’s a look at places with the most risk of damage from hurricane winds, as well as the reconstruction value from such phenomena.\\nMetro AreaNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to hurricane windsReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York3,765,489$1.961Philadelphia, Pennsylvania1,657,757$703.6Houston, Texas2,092,308$671.3Boston, Massachusetts1,347,819$669.5Miami, Florida2,048,827$511.4Tampa, Florida1,107,320$294.5Providence, Rhode Island483,033$211.7Virginia Beach, Virginia583,928$186.4Jacksonville, Florida580,352$167.9Richmond, Virginia435,597$153.6Hartford, Connecticut353,537$150.3Bridgeport, Connecticut212,853$135.8New Orleans, Louisiana442,099$135.1North Port, Florida398,672$107.7\\nMany of the metro areas with the most at-risk homes also tend to be in areas that are familiar with hurricane damage. Hurricane Sandy, for example, caused an estimated $19 billion in damages and lost economic activity across New York City in 2012. As the most densely populated city in the U.S., it’s not a surprise that it tops the list of the most homes at risk of damage from storm surges and hurricane winds.\\nHere’s a look at those places most likely to see coastal flooding, as well as the reconstruction value.\\nNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to storm surgeReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York878,226$415.4Virginia Beach, Virginia396,843$124.8Miami, Florida509,133$124.0Tampa, Florida448,013$109.5New Orleans, Louisiana320,908$99.3Cape Coral, Florida318,004$78.4North Port, Florida254,218$64.6Boston, Massachusetts148,005$59.5Naples, Florida196,454$54.9Charleston, South Carolina148,987$53.3Houston, Texas192,937$52.6Jacksonville, Florida154,177$46.1Philadelphia, Pennsylvania120,426$42.1Salisbury, Maryland138,295$40.9\\nOther metro areas, such as Miami and Houston, are also familiar with hurricanes. According to NOAA’s historical trackers, there have been 48 and 28 hurricanes within 60 nautical miles of Miami and Houston’s counties since the beginning of the 20th century.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Protect Your Property During Hurricane Season\\nFor homeowners and real estate investors who own property in areas that are more prone to hurricane and storm damage, it’s essential to understand and know the risks these storms present to your property, Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, told BiggerPockets. “When you know your risk, you can accelerate your recovery,” she added.\\nShe added that the other key to preparing is to understand your insurance policy, knowing what is covered and what isn’t. For example, flood insurance is not mandatory unless the property is mortgaged and in a FEMA-designated flood zone. If a property is damaged by flooding and isn’t covered, you could end up footing the bill yourself.\\n“As we have seen from events like Hurricane Harvey in 2017, flooding damage can be extreme and often not limited to designated flood zones, so understanding what is covered is critical. That’s not something you want to find out after a home has sustained hurricane damage,” Bolton-Smith said.\\nBesides insurance, you can also fortify your home, such as making sure the roof is in good condition and there are no loose shingles, as well as ensuring there are no large trees or other items that could damage your home, she added.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes It Still Make Sense to Buy In Areas Prone to Climate Disasters?\\xa0\\nHurricanes and other climate disasters have been more frequent and extreme in recent years. This increases the risk of potential property damage and costs—and has caused insurance premiums to skyrocket in many areas. And it seems that this trend will only get worse, with as many as 40 million homes at risk of a spike in insurance premiums.\\xa0\\n“The reality is, risk of some kind is present in most places,” said Bolton-Smith. She lives in California, which faces both earthquake and wildfire risks. And while it’s unlikely a hurricane would hit every area mentioned in CoreLogic’s report, there is a chance of multiple disaster events in one year.\\nStill, technology and building codes have greatly improved to ensure that homes are fortified against risk, such as with magnesium siding or reinforced doors and windows.\\nUltimately, “I think it comes down to understanding the potential risk and deciding whether you’re comfortable with it and knowing what resources you have to mitigate it,” Bolton-Smith said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Data-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by PropStream. Read our\\xa0editorial guidelines\\xa0for more information.\\nThe housing market is an increasingly challenging place for investors right now. The costs of investing in real estate are undoubtedly rising, with more funds required both upfront and on an ongoing basis. Additionally, competition for good investment leads is fierce amid an ongoing shortage of homes for sale.\\nFortunately, there are solutions to these challenges. They lie in the realm of precision data collection and analysis.\\nTop Real Estate Challenges in 2024\\nHere, we will cover the most pressing challenges facing real estate investors right now, and the ways in which data-backed tools can help them make game-changing tweaks to their investing strategies.\\xa0\\nLow inventory\\nThe challenge of low inventory is persistent, with no current indicators that it will improve anytime soon. Low inventory has shaped the U.S. housing market since the spike in interest rates from the historic low of 2.65% in 2021. Since then, interest rates have tripled with a high of over 8%, causing homeowner reluctance to sell due to the lock-in effect. Home sales have slowed dramatically since 2022.\\xa0\\nThe fact remains that current interest rates just cannot compete with the historically low rates homeowners locked in before 2022. Homeowners are hesitant to move and take on mortgages with much higher rates; their reluctance to sell is completely understandable. And although there are signs that interest rates are stabilizing, we’re just not there yet in terms of what sellers would like to see—and we won’t be there in 2024.\\xa0\\nAs Rick Sharga, founder, and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a market intelligence and business advisory firm, told Forbes, “I don’t expect to see a meaningful increase in the supply of existing homes for sale until mortgage rates are back down in the low-5% range, so probably not in 2024.”\\nLow inventory will continue propping up high home prices, and this will continue to present real estate investors with the challenge of finding affordable investment opportunities. However, there are ways investors can expand lead generation and maximize investment opportunities without having to wait for inventory to grow. The key is to identify off-market properties that are owned by motivated sellers—people who want to and have to sell sooner rather than later and will be more flexible on selling price.\\xa0\\nEnter PropStream. Its powerful data-filtering tools allows investors to search any market in the U.S. (over 155 million properties), identifying off-market properties with motivated homeowners who need to sell based on over 120 filter options.\\xa0\\nThis granular approach means that an investor can have a much better understanding of what exactly is motivating a particular seller. A seller motivated by financial distress and/or threat of foreclosure requires a different approach from one desiring a home upgrade or a retiring homeowner wanting to downsize.\\xa0\\nIdentifying motivated sellers with precision allows a potential investor to tailor the best possible offer that will be effective and attractive to the specific seller. This is a much better lead strategy overall than relying only on SEO and outbound marketing or referrals.\\xa0\\nTraditional lead-generation methods simply do not capture the entirety of existing opportunities. As an investor, you also can really stand out from the crowd if you are making a personalized offer that takes the seller’s specific circumstances into account.\\xa0\\nHigh interest rates\\nHigh interest rates hit investors, too, not just regular buyers. Inevitably, those higher monthly mortgage payments have to translate into higher rent charges, which can make it more difficult for investors to find and retain tenants.\\nTo illustrate the point, the average monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. reached $2,268 in 2023, an almost 50% hike from only two years before, when the average monthly payment was only $1,525.\\nHigher mortgage costs, coupled with rising home insurance costs, is bad news for investors at a time when rent growth is sluggish across the country. The solution? Access to more—and more accurate—data that will help investors identify better deals and combat the problem of higher monthly payments.\\xa0\\nFor example, filtering a property search by mortgage type, rate, and mortgage balance can help you zoom in on investment opportunities where an existing, low-rate mortgage could be transferred to you or where the mortgage balance is low and can be paid off sooner, making your investment more profitable in the longer term.\\nPropStream provides deep-dive insights into 155 million-plus properties nationwide, including mortgage and financial data. Armed with mortgage related information, you can make better investment decisions and achieve higher ROIs.\\xa0\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, it’s never wise to make an investment decision solely based on lower monthly payments. You may be focusing in on an area where there aren’t suitable properties with transferable mortgages, for instance.\\xa0\\nThe solution here is not to write off suitable leads with high-interest rate mortgages but to look into more financing options. Creative financing can be a viable option, for example.\\xa0\\nRemember: As an investor, you are not necessarily as constrained by a budget as a buyer who plans to live at a property. If the home is a lucrative investment opportunity and ticks all the other boxes, it can be worth it to secure alternative financing.\\xa0\\nHigh competition for affordable investment opportunities\\nFinally, there is no way around the fact that the overall higher cost of housing across the U.S. is leading to lower returns, creating a feeding frenzy among investors for more affordable properties. Everybody wants below-market-value homes, and when these hit the market, fierce competition ensues.\\xa0\\nMany investors rely on their local agents and the MLS to locate less expensive investment opportunities. The problem is that even if you have a good relationship with the agent and they have promised to alert you to new opportunities, it may just come down to where you are on their list of multiple investors.\\xa0\\nThe solution? Stop competing, and look where no one else is. You have to search beneath the tip of the iceberg for properties that haven’t yet been put on the market but could be soon.\\xa0\\nWhat you need to do is identify homeowners with a high propensity to sell in your area, gather relevant data about the situation and the property, and then craft an offer that both gives the homeowner confidence to sell and gives them a valuable solution to whatever issue they may be having with the property.\\xa0\\nIt’s important to stress that you’re not necessarily or exclusively looking at pre-foreclosure properties. A homeowner may be reluctant to sell because of the repairs the home needs (which they feel they can’t afford) or because they have an insurance problem. There are a whole range of situations out there, and it should be your goal as an investor to tailor the best possible outcome for both yourself and the seller.\\xa0\\nUtilizing PropStream’s data, you can identify properties that present profitable opportunities based on sellers’ current situations. Once you’ve located homeowners likely to want to sell, you can put yourself in a strong negotiating position by having access to the right data about the property.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout PropStream\\nPropStream® is the most trusted provider of comprehensive real estate data nationwide.

      "{'title': 'Home Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nU.S. national home prices have risen by 47% since 2020.While the residential real estate market gasps for more inventory, demand has also fallen with higher interest rates.Holding properties for the long-term is still the most sound real estate investment strategy, but be wary of stagnation and future decline. \\n\\nIf there was ever doubt about the profitability of real estate, a look at recent appreciation figures should put the argument to rest. According to a report by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, U.S. national home prices have surged a meteoric 47% since 2020.\\nHowever, just as home values can surge, they can also stagnate. The interest rate roller coaster we are now experiencing and the possibility of vacancies and repairs have made real estate too much of a white-knuckle ride for many looking for a stress-free investment.\\xa0\\nFor those willing to hold their nerve and play the long game, real estate can be an amazing vehicle for passive income, retirement, and generational wealth—provided you minimize your risks by avoiding common mistakes.\\nWhy Real Estate Is Such a Good Long-Term Investment\\nBefore delving into the dos and don’ts of investing, here are a few facts about the current market that recently highlight some of the benefits of buy-and-hold investing.\\nA 20% increase in 12 months after COVID\\nLow inventory has caused home prices to increase at an unprecedented clip, rising 20% in 12 months nationwide as of 2022, immediately after the pandemic, adding hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to personal home values and investment portfolios.\\xa0\\nHome prices have risen by more than double the inflation rate since 1960\\xa0\\n“If home prices had merely kept pace with inflation, the median home would cost only $177,500 today—compared to the $431,000 it actually costs,” said Matt Brannon, who authored a study for Clever Real Estate.\\nBuyers need to earn far more than they once did to be able to buy a home\\nA Zillow survey found that homeowners need to earn 80% more to comfortably afford a home than they did just four years ago. This means that there will be an increasing rental pool for landlords.\\nBuying with a high interest rate is better than waiting for rates to fall\\nBuying a home in recent years was like jumping onto the side of a runaway train and holding on for dear life. Though the speed of growth has finally slowed down, getting some skin in the game before rates drop and prices increase is a prudent move—provided you can afford it. Yes, renting in the short term might be cheaper, but if you buy for the long term, you will do better financially.\\n“Buyers who can afford to may want to get serious about their home search now, as housing costs are unlikely to fall anytime soon. The uptick in listings should be another motivator for buyers,” Redfin economic research lead Chen Zhao said in a recent report.You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Play the Long Game\\nBuyers today need to invest with a long-term strategy in mind. Expecting to find a turnkey home that cash flows from day one—unless you are assuming a mortgage or find a desperate seller and a great deal—is not feasible. Here are some fail-safe tips for investing in real estate in today’s turbulent market.\\nBuy an investment property first\\nHomeownership is the American dream, but there are multiple advantages to owning an investment property ahead of a primary residence, namely tax (depreciation) and—when interest rates eventually come down—cash flow, not to mention appreciation (which all real estate enjoys), mortgage paydown (courtesy of your tenants), and the opportunity to trade up with a 1031 exchange and defer capital gains taxes.\\nAs it is cheaper to rent now than pay a personal mortgage in the short term, there is no financial advantage to putting money into a personal residence. Also, it’s worth keeping your debt-to-income ratio low if you plan to keep investing and financing your deals.\\nDon’t accrue more properties than you can afford if things go bad\\nOne of the golden rules of real estate investing is to “expect things to go wrong, because they usually do.” Investors often need help when they have multiple vacancies or repairs at once. That’s why maximizing your income through full-time employment or liquidating assets will help you prepare for a rainy day should uncertainties arise (and they always do).\\nHouse flipping can be a huge help\\nFinding a below-market deal in the current low-inventory market is tough, but they are still out there. With prices rising rapidly, a well-renovated home in the right neighborhood will sell quickly. Augmenting your income with a few flips will allow you to build your rental portfolio.\\xa0\\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Auction.com, an online marketplace for distressed properties, estimated that between 2021 and 2023, some 654,000 U.S. homeowners were far behind on their mortgages when selling, usually to investors. High interest rates will likely push that number up this year, creating an opportunity for flippers.\\nSacrifice “paper” cash flow to invest in solid neighborhoods\\nThis is a mistake many new investors make: They calculate cash flow based on the cost of the property, expenses, and the rent it can generate. On paper, the homes that cash flow the most will always be in lower-end neighborhoods because they cost the least. However, these investments will always bring you the most headaches through nonpayment of rent, repairs, and tenant turnover. They will always appreciate the least, too.\\xa0\\nIf you want to be in real estate for the long game, invest in B- and above neighborhoods. What you don’t realize in cash flow in the early years, you will more than make up for in appreciation.\\nThink big\\nThe residential market might be gasping for inventory, but the commercial market is having a fire sale.\\xa0\\nBuying commercial real estate in distress doesn’t have to mean buying a skyscraper in a big city. There are plenty of small office spaces that are in trouble, too. Look on commercial real estate listing sites like LoopNet and CoStar to help you identify deals in your price range. Forming a syndication could help you pool resources. Buying and repurposing the building for residential use or alternative in-demand businesses such as data centers, vertical farming, and hospitality and leisure will help you attain lender funding for a cash-flowing adaptive reuse project.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe current real estate market is all about surviving now to thrive later. For the average investor who does not have a pile of cash, that means living low to the ground, with discretionary spending kept to a minimum to keep buying investments, calculating for a down payment and repairs.\\xa0\\nWith high prices and interest rates, cash flow will inevitably take a back seat. It’s essential to calculate a metric that works for you so you are not overleveraged and won’t be unduly stressed if you have a vacant apartment for a month or two. The greater the difference between your living expenses and income, the more you can dedicate to real estate.\\xa0\\nThe important thing is if you can afford it, get in the game now and don’t wait for rates to come down. You can always refinance when they do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'High Interest Rates Are Forcing Big-Time Investors to Cut Their Losses—Is a Bust Coming?', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nCommercial vacancies reached 17% in Q4 2023, higher than the peak vacancy rate during the 2008 financial crisis.As a result of high interest rates, high vacancies, and mounting costs, big-time commercial investors are selling off their assets at 50-80% value.Investors continue to be frustrated with the Federal Reserve's posture and mixed signals towards future rates, fearing that today's rates are the new normal. \\n\\n\\nThe sudden increase in interest rates has left many experienced\\xa0commercial real estate\\xa0owners gasping for air. It’s a tsunami of woe for landlords who own office and retail space and never saw it coming—and it threatens the nation’s entire real estate ecosystem.\\xa0\\nNot only have mortgage interest rates ascended skyward, with no easing in sight, but\\xa0remote work\\xa0and e-commerce have meant former tenants have vacated buildings with no sign of return.\\xa0Big cities like New York\\xa0have\\xa0been especially hit\\xa0hard.\\n“You\\xa0literally\\xa0have trillions of dollars of investment that are suddenly just massively impaired,” Dan Zwirn, chief executive of Arena Investors, a New York-based asset manager and real estate investor, told the\\xa0Wall Street Journal. “People thought of these office buildings as forever because, of course,\\xa0it’s going to\\xa0be 98% leased forever.”\\nProperty Owners Are Living on Borrowed Time\\nAccording to real estate consulting firm\\xa0Colliers, the vacancy rate in U.S. commercial buildings was\\xa0at\\xa017% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, higher than it was during the financial crash of 2008. Forgiving lenders don’t want to be saddled with foreclosed properties they can’t sell,\\xa0and so\\xa0are holding off on court proceedings. Remaining tenants who are current with rents are holding on, allowing buildings to stay afloat—for the time being.\\xa0\\nHowever, without fully rented buildings, limping\\xa0along\\xa0on borrowed time means maintenance issues will mount, and finding insurance on an almost insolvent building is challenging. Many landlords who\\xa0can\\xa0see the writing on the wall have decided to cut their losses. The\\xa0New York Times\\xa0reported that many commercial buildings\\xa0around the country\\xa0are\\xa0being sold\\xa0at a 50% to 80% discount.\\nAs the cycle continues, it’s not just commercial landlords of skyscrapers who are feeling the pinch. Landlords and businesses throughout major cities are hurting as workers move, and municipal budgets that rely on taxes associated with valuable commercial property face shortfalls as lower property tax assessments cut revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Empty Offices Affect Cities and Small Residential Landlords\\nWhen people no longer need to live in cities to work, the entire infrastructure of that city suffers, including smaller landlords who provide housing. Although the lack of inventory and high interest rates have forced people to keep renting instead of buying, it’s not surprising that there has been a\\xa0huge\\xa0movement away from expensive Northern cities since the pandemic.\\xa0\\nAccording to census data, New York City has been most affected, with\\xa078,000 people leaving in 2023. Overall, the state of New York lost 102,000 people. Most people leaving New York were not millionaires but the lower and middle class, earning between $32,000 and $65,000 who, without the need to\\xa0be tethered\\xa0to a costly city, were happy to give up high rents and cold weather.\\nHow Empty Offices Could Impact Banks and Loans for Other Smaller Investors\\nAccording to\\xa0Moody’s Analytics, the national office vacancy rate reached\\xa0a record\\xa019.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\xa0Not since\\xa01979\\xa0had offices been so empty.\\xa0\\nIf landlords foreclose or sell for less than they owe, that could spell big problems for banks that hold a lot of commercial real estate debt. The aftershocks could be felt throughout the\\xa0whole\\xa0lending industry, affecting smaller landlords seeking real estate loans.\\xa0\\n“We saw this play out last year: A bank gets in trouble, and that creates uncertainty in the market,” Dan Roccato, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego, told\\xa0CBS. “That uncertainty ripples through the stock market, that uncertainty ripples through the real estate market, and that uncertainty then shows up in your 401(k) plan at the end of the month.”\\xa0\\nThe result could be cities looking to make up the tax income shortfall from distressed and discounted commercial building sales by increasing revenue from residential property or sales taxes.\\nThe Waiting Game Gets Harder\\n“Survive until ‘25” is not a phrase any landlords struggling with high interest rates would have expected to hear at the start of the year when the Fed first touted a\\xa0series of rate cuts. However,\\xa0inflation‘s stubborn grip on the U.S. economy and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s steadfast position on refusing to cut rates until it falls has investors, homeowners, and many politicians\\xa0wringing their hands\\xa0in despair.\\xa0\\nAs we have seen from distressed commercial real estate sales and syndications with floating-rate\\xa0mortgages, holding on to underwater debt has become increasingly difficult. Banks, too, are feeling the heat, having to carry debt expected to\\xa0be paid off. On average, commercial real estate loans make up more than a fifth of U.S. banks’ overall loan portfolios. Many commercial landlords cough up borrowed cash to extend their loans until rates drop.\\xa0\\nAccording to CRED iQ analysis, New York landlords SL Green and Vornado had to find around\\xa0$100 million to extend\\xa0a $1.08 billion loan on an office building at 280 Park Avenue\\xa0in April.\\xa0Other owners have decided they can no longer afford to keep servicing the debt and would do better to deploy their money elsewhere.\\xa0This\\xa0is similar to what happened in the financial crash of 2008. Waiting in vain has its limits.\\n“Last year, borrowers were saying, ‘I just need three months for rate cuts to kick in,'” Alex Killick, a managing director at real estate services company CWCapital Asset Management, told the\\xa0Wall Street Journal. “We aren’t hearing that anymore. Powell sounded pretty clear that this is the new normal.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLetting properties go is always the last option for investors when the financial strain becomes unbearable. What frustrates many commercial property owners is that the Fed teased rate cuts and\\xa0then\\xa0backed off. They will inevitably happen, but when is the all-important question?\\nIn the meantime, the ropes tethering commercial buildings, lenders, owners, and an entire real estate infrastructure are starting to give, threatening businesses, livelihoods, and cities.\\xa0\\nAlthough no one saw the pandemic coming, the aftershocks must make politicians and landlords better prepared to handle other black swan events.

      "{'title': 'Yes, Tiny Homes Could Be the Most Cost-Effective Way to Cash Flow Right Now—Here’s Why', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBigger is\\xa0not always\\xa0better, especially\\xa0when it comes to\\xa0homes and mortgage payments.\\xa0High interest rates and soaring house prices have made developers, homeowners, and investors consider going smaller to make big money.\\xa0\\n“The monthly payment matters more than anything else, and builders have responded with smaller, more efficient homes,” John Burns, chief executive with Irvine, California-based firm\\xa0John Burns Research and Consulting, told the\\xa0New York Times.\\xa0\\nThe same article reveals that the median new U.S. home peaked at around 2,500 square feet in 2015. New homes have since shed about 200 square feet as costs rose, urban living boomed, and families got smaller. The current affordability crisis has shrunk the envelope even more, and many real estate investors have realized that they need to downsize the square footage of their investment homes to cash flow.\\nWhat Is a Tiny Home?\\nBut first, what is the definition of a tiny home?\\xa0\\nA tiny home is generally a dwelling that measures less than 400 square feet. Many\\xa0are constructed\\xa0on trailers, which makes them mobile. However, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and other small dwellings, such as cottages and in-law suites, can also be classified as tiny homes if they fit the rough dimensions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cost of Building a Tiny Home\\nOn average,\\xa0building a tiny home costs\\xa0a minimum of\\xa0$20,000, which is around 4% of the average\\xa0U.S. home sale price.\\xa0Custom-built homes with add-ons can double the price of a tiny\\xa0home, and a\\xa0home\\xa0on wheels usually costs between $60,000 and $80,000.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt’s worth noting that if your tiny home is mobile and located in your primary residence’s garden, you will not need to pay\\xa0property taxes. If it is on a foundation on a separate parcel of land, you\\xa0will need to\\xa0factor in the cost of buying the land and property taxes into your expenses.\\xa0\\nROI and Cash Flow\\nWith an outlay of over $100,000, what type of\\xa0cash flow\\xa0can you earn on a tiny home used for an investment? Much of it depends on your home’s location. If it is by a beach in a popular tourist destination, near a lake in a picturesque countryside, or in a major city in a home’s back garden, expect to earn high rents.\\xa0\\nAccording to short-term rental analytics site\\xa0AirDNA, Getaway, a start-up that rents tiny prefab cabins for $129 to $299 a night, raised $41.7 million in 2021. The cost of each cabin was around $40,000 per Airbnb investment.\\xa0\\nTechCrunch\\xa0revealed that Gateway experienced a nearly 100% occupancy rate for their properties. Rounding off the numbers for convenience, assuming\\xa0each home was rented\\xa0for $200/night for 300 nights per year, amounts to a total yearly income of $60,000 per year, which would pay off the cost of the cabin in its first year, with $20,000 left over for additional expenses.\\xa0\\nAirbnb co-founder\\xa0Joe Gebbia started Samara in 2022, a company specializing in prefab ADUs. This further points to the growing popularity of tiny houses as investments. By placing an ADU in their backyard, homeowners can forgo the expense of real estate taxes and earn extra money without having strangers in their living space.\\nCities Are Getting on Board the Tiny House Explosion\\nExpensive cities see ADUs as a way to alleviate their housing crises.\\xa0Although prohibitive short-term rental laws mean\\xa0they cannot be used\\xa0in places such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York for less than 30 days, they are a much-needed housing pressure valve for conventional yearly lease tenants or\\xa0for\\xa0homeowners in need of\\xa0more space.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADUs Could Be Great for Homeowners in Pricey Cities\\nCalifornia passed a series of laws in 2016 to make ADUs\\xa0easier\\xa0to build in the state by overriding local zoning and land use restrictions, enabling backyard homes. Los Angeles also\\xa0tried to spur the construction of ADUs\\xa0by experimenting with new financing methods and other solutions. New York City will help finance the construction of ADUs under its\\xa0Plus One ADU program\\xa0with no- or low-interest loans. Although tiny homes on wheels are\\xa0illegal in New York City, ADUs, which occupy backyards on already-owned homes, are allowed.\\nIt could be a fantastic way for homeowners to\\xa0bring in\\xa0extra income in a high-cost rental city.\\xa0As NYC’s Housing Preservation & Development website states:\\xa0“ADUs can serve a number of different purposes, providing housing to family members or serving as an added source of income for household expenses by renting an additional unit.”\\nIn major cities, however, the cost of constructing an ADU increases dramatically compared to that of a tiny home.\\xa0For example, Samara’s studio\\xa0starts at\\xa0$289,000, and the one-bedroom unit\\xa0starts at\\xa0$329,000, including installation costs.\\nMultiple states\\xa0have tiny home-friendly development laws, including:\\n\\nCalifornia\\nFlorida\\nGeorgia\\nKansas\\nNorth Carolina\\nOregon\\nTexas\\n\\nHowever, tiny homes are illegal in the following states:\\n\\nAlaska\\nIowa\\nLouisiana\\nNew Jersey\\nNew York\\nNorth Dakota\\nWest Virginia\\nWisconsin\\n\\nThinking Big\\nIf you’re thinking about instantly scaling your tiny home business, mobile home parks and trailer parks are good places to start because the grounds are already zoned for and equipped with amenities for\\xa0small\\xa0homes. It’s\\xa0fairly\\xa0straightforward to buy plots of land and replace existing trailers with tiny houses, which are modern, sustainable, and more livable than trailer homes.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nWhether you want to\\xa0downsize your living expenses\\xa0to reach financial freedom sooner by moving into a tiny home, turbo boost your investment capital by buying tiny homes for cash, or getting lower mortgages for multiple properties, the numbers don’t lie: Tiny homes are moneymakers.\\xa0\\nAppreciation is often the big question leveled at tiny homes.\\xa0Clearly,\\xa0mobile tiny homes probably depreciate rather than appreciate and do not carry the same tax advantages as tiny homes\\xa0that\\xa0are\\xa0built\\xa0on a foundation on separate parcels of land. For the latter, as with larger homes, the same holds\\xa0true\\xa0for\\xa0tiny\\xa0homes. The more valuable the land and the greater the number of improvements you have made on your\\xa0tiny\\xa0home, the greater the appreciation will likely be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Investors Are Putting Their Money in Build-to-Rent Homes at a Record Rate—What’s Causing the Frenzy?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nA record-high 27,500 build-to-rent homes were completed in 2023, almost triple the number of completions from two years prior. This year, the number of completions is set to nearly double.Institutional investors have poured large chunks of cash into build-to-rent homes. Blackstone, for example, has invested $9.5 billion into development.Most major metros are seeing record-high completions, but development is especially pronounced in Florida, Texas, and Arizona. \\n\\nInvestors are building single-family rental properties at an unprecedented rate, catering to a growing segment of renters seeking more space without the commitment of buying a home or the budget constraints of a high mortgage payment. A record-high 27,500 build-to-rent homes were completed in 2023, almost triple the number of completions from two years prior, according to an analysis of Yardi Matrix data from\\xa0RentCafe.\\nStarter homes are in short supply. In many areas of the country, entry-level homes listed below the area median home price are scarce. Even where these smaller, no-frills homes are on the market, they might not be affordable to the typical family due to a combination of stubbornly high home prices and high mortgage rates.\\xa0\\nFirst-time homebuyers have\\xa0come up with\\xa0several solutions to the\\xa0affordability\\xa0crisis, including\\xa0co-buying homes with their friends\\xa0and\\xa0living with their parents\\xa0to save for a down payment. Some are also settling for less square footage and shared walls, which has led to a boom in new\\xa0construction of\\xa0townhomes\\xa0or using the\\xa0house hacking\\xa0investment strategy to offset mortgage costs.\\xa0\\nBut for other millennials, finding a single-family home with plenty of bedrooms and a backyard in a neighborhood with good schools is still a top priority—even if it means they\\xa0have to\\xa0rent there. And some\\xa0remote workers\\xa0who prefer the amenities of a single-family home are choosing to rent for the freedom it provides. Therefore, demand for single-family rental homes has drawn interest from institutional investors and fueled a massive increase in the construction of homes intended for rent.\\xa0\\nMore Rental Homes on the Way\\nBuild-to-rent housing completions have rapidly increased since 2020, when only about 7,700 single-family rental homes\\xa0were completed. The trend will continue over the next couple of years, as more than\\xa045,400 rental properties\\xa0are currently under construction, most of which will be available for rent in 2025.\\xa0RentCafe anticipates moderation in new rental property construction in the coming years, however.\\xa0\\nIn some cases, investors build single-family rental homes within communities\\xa0that have\\xa0a mix of renters and owners. But there’s also been a rise in the construction of single-family rental communities.\\xa0These planned\\xa0build-to-rent communities\\xa0are neighborhoods of single-family homes, sometimes including\\xa0multifamily\\xa0units as well, all\\xa0of\\xa0which\\xa0share a common property manager and may feature community amenities such as outdoor spaces and fitness centers.\\xa0\\nBuild-to-rent housing draws interest from renters who\\xa0not only\\xa0want more space, but also\\xa0the newest home features. About 41% of the country’s build-to-rent houses were constructed within the last five years. A build-to-rent neighborhood holds similar appeal to a newly constructed for-sale development\\xa0while\\xa0often requiring a lower housing payment and allowing renters the freedom to move on without the hassle of selling.\\xa0\\nInvestors and developers have noticed the growing demand for these communities, and institutional investment in the asset class\\xa0is poised\\xa0for growth, according to a report from\\xa0Cushman and Wakefield.\\xa0For example, over the last few years, Blackstone has poured\\xa0over $9.5 billion\\xa0cash into single-family rental property investment.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMetro Areas with the Most Build-to-Rent Activity\\nIn\\xa014 of the top 20 major metro areas for build-to-rent housing, the number of completed units reached a 10-year peak.\\xa0\\nIn 2023, Phoenix stood out as a hotbed for build-to-rent activity, with more than 4,000 units completed. That’s a 164% year-over-year increase in newly built rental properties.\\xa0The\\xa0city has a growing population and plenty of land for expansion, according to\\xa0RentCafe.\\xa0In some\\xa0high-demand coastal cities, limited space for development has prevented the build-to-rent movement from taking hold.\\xa0\\nIn Dallas, almost 2,700 rental homes\\xa0were finished\\xa0in 2023, and Atlanta followed behind with\\xa0almost\\xa02,000 build-to-rent completions. Those three cities also saw the highest numbers of build-to-rent housing completed over the last five years, with a rapidly increasing availability of single-family rental properties\\xa0when\\xa0compared to 2018.\\xa0For example,\\xa0there were\\xa0only about 500 build-to-rent units available in Atlanta as of 2018.\\xa0By 2023, that number increased to over 4,000.\\xa0\\nThe top five states for completed build-to-rent homes in 2023 were all in the Sunbelt:\\n\\nTexas:\\xa04,800 units\\nArizona:\\xa04,000 units\\nFlorida:\\xa02,800 units\\nGeorgia:\\xa02,181 units\\nSouth Carolina:\\xa01,909 units\\n\\nIn Texas, build-to-rent housing is\\xa0particularly popular, and new construction in cities like Dallas, Houston, and Austin will only increase the already significant supply in the coming years.\\xa0And in\\xa0Florida, new build-to-rent construction is booming across\\xa0a few different\\xa0metros.\\nRentCafe also identified the other top markets with the most build-to-rent construction in progress. These metro areas have at least 1,000 new build-to-rent homes currently under construction, which are likely to be available to renters by 2026:\\nMetro AreaBuild-to-Rent Units Under ConstructionPhoenix, Arizona7,236Dallas, Texas6,481Houston, Texas4,836Huntsville, Alabama2,487Charlotte, North Carolina2,426Atlanta, Georgia2,341San Antonio, Texas1,886Austin, Texas1,851Jacksonville, Florida1,836Tampa, Florida1,352Orlando, Florida1,147Salt Lake City, Utah1,141Nashville, Tennessee1,087Columbus, Ohio1,059Savannah, Georgia\\xa01,000\\nInvesting in Build-to-Rent Housing\\nThe current demand for single-family rental homes with modern amenities makes build-to-rent housing an attractive investment\\xa0opportunity that offers the\\xa0opportunity for stable cash flow. There are a few options for getting into the game, some with more obstacles than others:\\xa0\\n\\nBuild a single-family rental:\\xa0One option is to buy a plot of land in a growing area and build an ideal rental home.

      "{'title': 'The Best Appliances to Boost Your Rental Property’s Value—and Bonus Tips For Saving Money', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRental properties come in all shapes, sizes, and prices, as do many of the appliances that go in them. Assuming, however, that your rental is not a sprawling Beverly Hills mansion, a luxury condo in Manhattan, or, conversely, a trailer in Ohio, but rather a quality middle-class home or apartment of around 1,000 square feet in a decent neighborhood, choosing the right appliance for the home can be confusing.\\xa0\\nHere are some things to bear in mind.\\nCost\\nThe appliances in your investment property should suit the rental price. You\\xa0are not going to\\xa0put a $100,000 La Cornue range in a $1,500-per-month rental apartment. The key to choosing the right appliance for any rental is to find one that looks stylish and works well without spending a fortune. All tenants want to see modern stainless steel (or some version of such) appliances in their homes, which means staying away from\\xa0basic\\xa0white or black appliances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign Your Kitchen Around Your Range\\nThe good news is that dozens of cost-efficient appliances fit these criteria. Expect to spend anywhere from $800 to $1,300 for a solid, good-looking range.\\xa0Multiple companies\\xa0offer these types of standard 30-inch ranges that fit these criteria. GE, Frigidaire, and Whirlpool are among the most popular for rentals.\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0New York\\xa0Times‘\\xa0Wirecutter is a good, impartial place to\\xa0start researching\\xa0appliances. Although they have links to retailers and receive commissions from sales, the writers themselves—to quote the\\xa0Times—”are never made aware of any business relationships with retailers, and products\\xa0are recommended\\xa0(or not) independent of all business and financial interests.”\\xa0\\nHaving written a blog for an appliance retailer in the past, I cannot say that is true for other reviews on the web. I still fondly remember the free meals in a luxury appliance manufacturer’s plush Manhattan showroom—not to mention the closet full of free promo materials!\\nAs your range is the centerpiece of your kitchen, around which the main action occurs, I’ve always found it best to choose my other appliances around it. It’s also cost-effective and easy, and online stores offer appliance packages once you have\\xa0chosen\\xa0one item at deep discounts compared to buying each item individually.\\nCooktop or range?\\nGenerally speaking, ranges (also called stoves) are cheaper than cooktops, which sit on top of the counter and usually need slabs to\\xa0be cut\\xa0to accommodate them. Slide-in ranges are convenient, cost-effective, and easy to clean, service, and replace for rentals.\\xa0\\nGas or electric?\\nUnless you’re renting to Gordon Ramsay (in which case, congratulations, you’re rich!), having a naked flame in a rental unit is not a good idea. Electric ranges are easy to clean, present far less fire hazard, and are usually reasonably priced. Electric ranges are also better for the environment.\\nIt’s also worth noting that the world is trying to move away from fossil fuels, and\\xa0some American cities have outlawed gas ranges entirely. Regardless of where you stand politically on the issue, the tide of change is undeniable. In 10 years, electric cars will be the norm, as will fully electric homes (unless you own a wood-heated log cabin). It’s best to save yourself the hassle of buying new appliances and\\xa0get with\\xa0the electric program now.\\nInduction or not?\\nWhen I\\xa0first\\xa0started putting induction ranges in my rental units a few years back, contractors and other investors looked at me as if I had antennae sprouting from my head.\\xa0\\nInduction cooktops and ranges look and function like typical glass-top electric models, except they cook via a magnetic field. On most 30-inch induction cooktops, the field\\xa0is concentrated\\xa0into four spots (or elements).\\xa0This\\xa0means they do not emit heat like conventional electric cooktops but rather cook through a magnetic field when a pot or pan with a compliant circular pattern on the bottom (most have them)\\xa0is placed\\xa0on top.\\nIt’s\\xa0not as complicated as\\xa0it sounds.\\xa0They\\xa0cook like with an electric cooktop—just without any heat (you can put your bare hand on an element when it is turned on and not feel a thing). However, in a country often resistant to change, they have\\xa0not taken off in the U.S.\\xa0to the same extent as they have in Europe, where their use is widespread.\\xa0\\nThere are obvious advantages:\\n\\nSafety:\\xa0No risk of fire or burning.\\xa0This\\xa0could result in reduced insurance premiums.\\nEnergy efficiency:\\xa0Induction cooking is\\xa010% more energy efficient\\xa0than conventional electric cooking.\\nFast:\\xa0Waiting for a pan to heat up is not an issue, as the moment a compliant pan\\xa0is placed\\xa0on top, it cooks the food.\\nEasy cleanup:\\xa0There is no danger of food getting burned on the top of the cooktop because it never gets hot.\\nPeace of mind:\\xa0Landlords have one less thing to worry about since a stove fire will not happen in their rental unit.\\nMake venting easier:\\xa0Since naked flames are not a risk in your kitchen, there is no need for an industrial-sized vent that looks like it belongs in a commercial kitchen.\\xa0\\nYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the negative side, induction ranges are generally more expensive than conventional electric models (expect to\\xa0pay around $1,300\\xa0for a standard model that would suit mid-priced rentals). Also, some tenants might find using them takes some getting used to, and if you\\xa0are switching\\xa0from gas, rewiring your kitchen could be costly.\\nWith Refrigerators, Beware of Ice Dispensers\\nChoosing an applicable refrigerator\\xa0usually\\xa0comes down to kitchen space. Measure\\xa0before you buy.\\nHowever, steer clear of fridge freezers with exterior ice dispensers. While these might suit a personal residence, I never use them in rentals. Tenants are not meticulous about how much ice they dispense or the cleanup when some of it lands on the floor. Despite your waterproof tile or vinyl plank flooring, excess water on the floor is never a good idea. Also, they can be prone to leaks and malfunctions and be challenging to repair.\\nWasher-Dryers\\nAs the world moves away from gas, your choice of dryer to accompany your washer will be limited to electric. Like stoves, many people swear against electric drying, but if\\xa0you have a choice of bringing gas lines into the house and the inherent risk they pose, along with the opportunity to future-proof your rental business, electric dryers make sense.\\nRegarding the brand or size, stackable or side-by-side, there are hundreds of choices, and yours should\\xa0be based\\xa0on budget, size of the rental, and number of tenants.\\xa0I\\xa0won’t\\xa0get into the minutiae of\\xa0all\\xa0the configurations.\\xa0However, I will offer a few broader brush strokes of advice.\\xa0\\nStay away from all-in-one washers and dryers.\\xa0They\\xa0are just\\xa0not\\xa0that\\xa0efficient\\xa0yet, particularly when it comes to drying.\\xa0 As a last resort, if you are space-challenged, you might be forced to buy one. Frankly, though, a clothes rack would prove a less frustrating experience.\\nShort-Term Rentals\\nIf you have\\xa0short-term rentals,\\xa0as I do,\\xa0my advice is\\xa0to\\xa0opt for a commercial-grade washer and dryer.\\xa0They might not look as fancy as residential-use ones, but with a high volume of laundry and guests who are not concerned about the upkeep of your appliances, a commercial-grade combo is the way to go.\\xa0\\nSpeed Queen\\xa0has had this market locked down for decades. They are durable workhorses with\\xa0great\\xa0warranties.\\xa0\\nFrigidaire and Whirlpool\\nFrom my experience in the appliance business, two brands dominated the mid-range rental and flip business: Frigidaire and Whirlpool, for\\xa0the reasons I stated earlier—they look good, work well, and are reasonably priced. While higher-end brands such as Miele, Bosch, and Thermador come with a certain amount of glamour and prestige, unless you have luxury rentals, it’s not worth spending the money on luxury appliances.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFinal Thoughts\\nAppliances are often their last thought when outfitting a rental for many landlords. For tenants, appliances are often their first thought. That’s why many landlords opt to buy used appliances. Used appliances can save money in the short term but prevent you from charging higher rents and not having warranties for new appliances.\\xa0\\nOther things to bear in mind:\\n\\nCost segregation:\\xa0Under\\xa0tax law section 179, landlords may deduct the cost of appliances on their taxes.\\nInclude the upkeep of new appliances in your leases:\\xa0Your\\xa0rental lease\\xa0should have a clause that lists all included appliances and stipulates any special maintenance requirements or responsibilities.\\xa0This\\xa0will hold tenants accountable for their upkeep.\\nEnergy rating:\\xa0Many tenants move because of high utility bills. Low costs through energy-efficient appliances are\\xa0good\\xa0for your bottom line and the planet.\\nAppliance warranties:\\xa0Choose appliances with excellent repair\\xa0warranties. You can often negotiate an extended warranty with the retailer, particularly if you have multiple rentals and offer them ongoing business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind the Right Agent, Find the Right Property\\nStep #1: Use Agent Finder to match with top investor-friendly real estate agents to help you find, analyze, and close your next deal.\\n\\nFind an Agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Detroit Beat Its Post-Pandemic Downtown Doom Loop—Here’s How Investors Can Benefit', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\xa0mayor in handcuffs, a\\xa0bankrupt city\\xa0mired in poverty, unemployment, and soaring crime: 10 years ago that was Detroit’s legacy. Today, it is a real estate success story.\\xa0\\nEarly investors—to quote one of Motown’s most famous songs—are dancing in the street. Developers are pouring billions of dollars into its business district, luring the likes of Ford, Quicken Loans, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and more to take up office space. There’s even a\\xa0Gucci\\xa0store—the city’s first. The spillover has resulted in booming residential home prices—up 40% since 2020—and revitalized neighborhoods.\\nVacant Buildings to Residential Space\\nDetroit’s tale is one that other cities such as Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco, experiencing the post-pandemic\\xa0downtown doom loop\\xa0of empty offices and increased vagrancy, could do well to emulate. A total of\\xa040-plus major construction projects\\xa0have been completed or are being completed downtown since 2018, and thanks to new construction and repurposed former vacant buildings, there will be\\xa09,567\\xa0more residential units in 2024 than in 2021.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreserving and Repurposing Historic Buildings\\nIn this respect, Detroit has succeeded where other cities have failed,\\xa0in part\\xa0because many of the city’s downtown office buildings are almost a century old, with small floors and stylish architecture that convert well into residential buildings—unlike the 1970s and ’80s glassy towers in other cities.\\xa0\\nSpearheading this conversion is Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native and the billionaire co-founder of home lender Rocket Mortgage. This pioneer moved his company to downtown from the suburbs in 2010. He told the\\xa0Wall Street Journal, “We\\xa0really\\xa0had three options: Extend the leases, go to some farmland and build a campus—which wasn’t\\xa0really\\xa0attractive to us—or come downtown and fill up some of these beautiful old buildings that we\\xa0really\\xa0loved.”\\nMaking Downtown a Destination for More Than Work\\nGilbert’s companies bought\\xa0more than\\xa0130 properties downtown, spending billions on revitalizing the city and encouraging other companies to take advantage of cheap office space in gorgeous buildings. Ford Motor Company, always synonymous with the city, is spending $900 million to redevelop Michigan Central, the city’s abandoned train station—opening in June—and surrounding properties. Start-ups are streaming in.\\xa0\\nHowever, to make Downtown less office-dependent, casinos, sports venues, and revamped aging theaters have added a vibrant nightlife appeal. Developers have responded to generous tax breaks to build, and the knock-on effect has been increased condo and apartment prices.\\n“Best Investment in America”\\nResidential property values in the city climbed an average of\\xa023% last year, marking the seventh straight year of growth. Values rose 31% in 2022 and 8% per neighborhood from 2021 numbers. In total, all 208 of the city’s neighborhoods saw increases.\\nMayor Mike Duggan gleefully called the city the “best investment in America.” Some neighborhoods, such as Campau/Banglatown, New Center Commons, DelRay, and Carbon Works,\\xa0saw their values increase\\xa0by more than 50%. A strategic plan to keep\\xa0real estate taxes\\xa0low has helped.\\n“Since 2018, Detroit property values have exploded, not your tax rate,” Duggan said in a statement. “It stayed down here, and today, the average Detroiter is\\xa0being taxed\\xa0at half their assessed value.”\\nA Haven for House Flippers\\nAs such, in recent years, Detroit has been a haven for\\xa0house flippers\\xa0and new residents. Duggan said about 15,000 homes, as well as parks, streetscapes, and streetlights, saw improvements. He also mentioned the Detroit Land Bank’s declining inventory, which has gone from 45,000 abandoned homes in 2014 to less than 5,000 today.\\nToday, Detroit remains\\xa0extremely\\xa0affordable.\\xa0According to\\xa0Realtor.com,\\xa0the median listing home price is $89,900, and the median sold home price is $79,000.\\xa0Although the current 4,236 homes for sale cover a wide range of prices—everywhere from $750 for a lot to $8.6 million for a 36,000-square-foot\\xa0multifamily\\xa0property—investing and raising a family in a decent Detroit neighborhood is\\xa0extremely\\xa0achievable.\\nRents have also increased in the city, making it\\xa0a\\xa0profitable\\xa0place\\xa0for out-of-town landlords to invest.\\xa0They often\\xa0buy houses for cash. The\\xa0same amount of money would only pay for a\\xa0down payment\\xa0elsewhere.\\xa0\\n“Market sales are 58%, and distress[ed] sales are about 42%,” City Councilman Coleman A. Young II told the\\xa0Detroit News. “That’s one of the first times that we’ve had more market sales than distress[ed] sales in\\xa0the city of\\xa0Detroit.” In 2013, 90% of Detroit’s homes were sold for cash, as borrowers could not obtain a mortgage.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut There Are Still Issues\\nDespite the massive new development and rising house prices, investing in a Detroit fixer-upper is far from a cakewalk, as this\\xa0New York Times article\\xa0reveals.\\xa0Finding a quality, honest contractor\\xa0can still be\\xa0tough, and\\xa0nefarious\\xa0characters are around, ready to steal tools and worse. “Welcome to Detroit” is a phrase often used by jaded police officers when out-of-state investors fall victim to crime.\\xa0\\nAll this means that out-of-town investors still have to pick and choose neighborhoods to buy in carefully, and having the help of\\xa0knowledgeable real estate investors\\xa0and property managers in the area is a huge benefit.\\xa0\\nOther Cities Like Detroit Where Investment Makes Sense\\nIt’s hard to find cities like Detroit, where house prices\\xa0are\\xa0still\\xa0incredibly low,\\xa0and\\xa0yet tremendous development and appreciation have occurred.\\xa0That’s because Detroit scratched its way up from bankruptcy when the loose change in your pocket could have bought you a home there a decade ago.\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0major\\xa0cities experiencing downtown problems\\xa0are\\xa0still\\xa0too\\xa0expensive to invest in, whereas other\\xa0affordable Midwestern cities, such as Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Cleveland, have been\\xa0losing workers\\xa0in their downtowns, resulting in a loss of residents.\\xa0\\nHowever,\\xa0several Midwestern cities, such as Canton and Akron, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; and Springfield, Missouri, have emulated Detroit, reinventing themselves with new businesses and attracting new residents.

      "{'title': 'Should You Invest for Cash Flow or Appreciation? Let’s Reevaluate in an Era of High Interest Rates', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor real estate investors, the question of cash flow versus appreciation is as old as time.\\xa0However, in an\\xa0era of\\xa0high interest\\xa0rates, buying properties for cash flow\\xa0isn’t easy.\\xa0That doesn’t mean investing should be off the table, as there are many advantages of owning rentals other than immediate cash flow—appreciation and tax advantages being the most obvious.\\xa0\\nWhether to keep buying or stay\\xa0on the sidelines comes down to some specific decisions.\\xa0Let’s dig deeper.\\nThe Higher the Cash Flow, the Greater the Headaches\\nThe less expensive the property, the greater the cash flow. That’s the theory, anyway. Rentals in low-income neighborhoods might cost less, but tenants also earn less and cannot withstand the financial hurdles that life throws\\xa0at\\xa0them. Thus, potential cash flow numbers\\xa0are rarely achieved\\xa0due to vacancies, repairs, and evictions.\\xa0\\nBuying multiple doors in C or D+ neighborhoods has the potential to turn into one big headache.\\xa0This\\xa0was exposed during the pandemic when most tenants seeking a pause in rental payments and an\\xa0eviction moratorium\\xa0were from\\xa0lower-income areas. The landlords greatest affected were smaller mom-and-pop owners who fell behind on mortgage payments, ruing the day they chose to invest where they did.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Section 8 Caveat\\nSome might champion Section 8 rentals, but the hurdles of dealing with Section 8 inspectors and hoping your tenants maintain your property often make the experience hard for investors who got into real estate to lessen life’s stresses rather than add to them.\\xa0\\nHowever, with interest rates higher than\\xa0they have been\\xa0in years, the only places to cash flow are likely cheaper properties in lower-income neighborhoods.\\xa0Many successful landlords are in these areas, but it is\\xa0not\\xa0a\\xa0passive\\xa0venture.\\xa0Stabilizing buildings and maintaining repairs and rents is a full-time, labor-intensive endeavor.\\nParking Your Cash for Appreciation and Tax Benefits\\nNot needing cash flow is the enviable position many investors want to get to because it means you are already financially free. According to CoreLogic’s U.S. Home Price Insights, nationwide,\\xa0prices increased by 5.5%\\xa0year over year as of December 2023.\\xa0This\\xa0coincides with a healthy job market, wage growth, and lowered inflation.\\nUsing a 5% metric, if you own an investment property valued at $200,000, your home would have appreciated\\xa0by\\xa0around $10,000 in one year. That’s the equivalent of cash flowing just under $1,000/month. In the current interest rate climate, that’s a tough ask.\\nIf you own $2 million worth of real estate, you would have increased your net worth by $100,000. Added to this are the\\xa0tax benefits\\xa0of\\xa0depreciation, repair, and operating expenses associated with real estate, which means even if you are not cash-flowing, you are still building wealth.\\xa0Refinancing\\xa0will add cash flow to the equation when rates eventually drop.\\xa0\\nBetter Neighborhoods Equals Lower Cash Flow\\nThe problem with investing in highly appreciating areas is that they generally\\xa0do not\\xa0cash flow\\xa0well\\xa0because they are more expensive.\\xa0However, when factored against tenant issues in lower-income neighborhoods, holding on to a good asset in a more upscale neighborhood is likely\\xa0to be\\xa0more beneficial in appreciation, even if it only pays for itself. The cash flow will also increase once the asset\\xa0is paid down\\xa0and the rents\\xa0increase.\\nThe Case for Cash Flow\\nMany\\xa0syndicators\\xa0utilize the strategy of forcing appreciation through value-added improvements that increase cash flow to attract investors who would otherwise be unwilling to invest.\\n“We never invest for\\xa0appreciation,\\xa0since that is out of our control,” Tyler Cauble of\\xa0The Cauble Group, a commercial real estate investor and consultant, told\\xa0bestevercre.com. “Our team selects projects where we can create value and force appreciation through value-add or development from scratch. Any appreciation is just icing on top.”\\nJonathan Barr of\\xa0JB2 Investments, a multifamily syndicator, concurred: “I would say: Always invest for cash flow—but inevitably, increased positive cash flow\\xa0is followed\\xa0by appreciation.”\\nGrant Cardone is one of the most voluble proponents of the cash flow model. On\\xa0gctv.com, he poses the cash flow versus appreciation question—and answers it this way:\\n“Whenever someone asks me if cash flow or appreciation is better when investing in real estate, I\\xa0give them a dumbfounded look\\xa0because they should already know the answer.\\xa0Cash flow investments provide a regular stream of income. In contrast, appreciation investments offer the potential for a more significant return if the investment is sold at a higher price than the purchase price. Getting wealthy from real estate investments is possible. You\\xa0have to\\xa0focus on cash flow, and the market fluctuation won’t affect you as much.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs It Possible to Cash Flow Without Giving Your Money to a Syndicator?\\nDespite what most syndicator salespeople might claim, handing your cash over to them should require first knowing the details of their financing. Without this knowledge, you are taking a leap of faith. In an era of fluctuating interest rates, only long-term financing attained before the rise in rates can insulate an operator against financial difficulties.\\xa0\\nIf you want to maintain autonomy and cash flow on your investment properties, here are some steps to take:\\n\\nBuy under-market properties that need work, complete the work, and increase rents.\\nMake a\\xa0large\\xa0down payment\\xa0to ensure the home cash flows, and refinance once rates drop.\\nAdd bedrooms by converting attics and larger rooms to increase cash flow.\\nRent by the room to add rental income.\\nUse your property as a\\xa0short-term rental, if possible.\\xa0According to AirDNA, STRs generate\\xa061% more income\\xa0than regular rentals. The STR market\\xa0continues to grow\\xa0despite higher interest rates, as lower inflation has increased travel, AirDNA says.\\nSecure noninstitutional financing from a family member at a lower rate.\\nEnter into a\\xa0subject-to-agreement\\xa0with the current owner, keep the current mortgage in place, and refinance them out of the property when rates drop.\\nLiquidate other assets to buy the home for cash at a discounted price and refinance when rates drop.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nInterest rates are the differentiator in the cash flow versus appreciation argument. Although many syndicators and gurus might preach that “cash flow is king,” with rates unlikely to drop substantially in a robust economy, a more nuanced approach could be beneficial—if you can afford it.\\xa0\\nIf you are not in a rush to quit your job and can afford to ride out high rates, buying for appreciation and tax advantages while waiting for a refinance to cash flow later could be wise. There’s little doubt that prices will soar as rates drop.\\xa0\\nHowever, if you don’t have cash reserves and must find a cash-flowing investment, you’ll need to make a risk-versus-reward decision. Hitching your financial wagon to a syndicator without the requisite research is\\xa0a risk. Implementing some of the strategies mentioned here could work. Also, waiting until you are in a better financial position to invest could be prudent.\\nAs an experienced investor who enjoys their job (I write for BiggerPockets!), I have taken the somewhat uncomfortable move of stocking up on real estate in solid B/B+ neighborhoods, leveraging myself\\xa0in a way\\xa0that I wouldn’t necessarily advise others, taking the tax breaks over cash flow, and waiting for rates to fall. It’s a long-term approach that I have watched other investors successfully employ. It’s not for everyone, but having endured wipeouts\\xa0previously, I’ve come to appreciate the value of holding solid assets in good areas. Cash flow is\\xa0wonderful, but to expect it overnight is, I’ve discovered, often wishful thinking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Growing Home Insurance Costs Will Destroy Your Cash Flow—Here’s What You Can Do About It', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReal estate investors are usually most concerned about rental income and property taxes. They seldom discuss home insurance. Many assume that home insurance is a standard fixed price in most parts of the country and give it scant regard, but you could be making a big mistake if you are one of those people.\\xa0\\nAccording to insurance.com, the average cost of home insurance nationwide hovers around $2,800 per year, which equates to $231 monthly for $300,000 in dwelling coverage and liability and a $1,000 deductible. However, this number fluctuates throughout the country. As a real estate investor, it’s important to note that the numbers quoted are for owner-occupied homeowners insurance.\\xa0Landlords\\xa0should add another 25%.\\nUnsurprisingly, the states with the biggest risk of\\xa0natural disasters\\xa0(hail, storms, tornadoes, flooding) have the highest insurance rates. The insurance.com data says the top five most expensive states for home insurance—where average rates range from $4,142 to $5,317 per year—are:\\n\\nOklahoma\\nKansas\\nNebraska\\nArkansas\\nTexas\\n\\nThe insurance.com data reveals that the five states with the lowest home insurance rates—where rates range from $582 to $1,551—are:\\n\\nHawaii\\nCalifornia\\nWashington, D.C.\\nVermont\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nPerhaps the most surprising state on the list of low insurance rates is Hawaii. However, don’t be fooled. Hawaii is so cheap because it excludes damage from hurricanes. That’s why, as a landlord,\\xa0reading the fine print of what your policy does and doesn’t cover\\xa0is so important.\\nAlthough weather is the most important factor in determining your insurance rate, other things to consider include population density, proximity to potential areas of risk such as woodlands (wildfires), rivers, and busy roads, or conversely, proximity to fire hydrants and fire departments. The historical risk for claims in your area could also affect insurance.\\nHow a Landlord Can Lower the Cost Of Insurance\\nThere are things landlords can do to keep the necessary cost of insuring properties as low as possible, including the following.\\xa0\\nEnsure your property is well-maintained\\nRegular maintenance will ensure that cracks, leaks, faulty smoke alarms, mold, and infestations are spotted early and taken care of.\\xa0\\nIn addition, make sure your property has these features:\\n\\nClosed fire doors\\nWell-lit hallways\\nClear, clean walkways\\nFunctional fire escapes\\xa0\\nA strong roof and foundation\\n\\nIncrease your deductible amount\\nIncreasing your deductible (the amount you have to pay before your insurance kicks in) lowers your landlord insurance premium costs and prevents unreasonable claims. By saving money on your premium, you can purchase additional insurance against other claims.\\nEmphasize safety\\nAn insurance company rewards landlords who take safety seriously. Make sure you emphasize:\\n\\nSecurity cameras\\nInterior and exterior lighting\\nAlarm systems\\nSmoke and CO2 detectors\\xa0\\nConnected smart security devices\\n\\nUpgrade your property’s main systemsYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany insurance claims come from faulty main electrical, plumbing, and heating systems. Ensuring that your system is regularly checked and has been upgraded with modern systems (provide as much information as possible so insurers can verify) helps you get better pricing when it comes time to renew your policy.\\nGet a master landlord policy\\nIf you have a sizable portfolio, getting all your properties insured under a single policy ensures better premium rates. A master landlord insurance policy also means less paperwork and monitoring of multiple individual policies.\\nShop around\\nYou’ll be surprised just how much insurance quotes can differ. Dedicate some time to shopping around. Go online, ask other local landlords which companies or brokers they use, and get multiple quotes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInsurance Coverage Types for Landlords\\nAs a landlord, these are some things you’ll need to consider including in your policy:\\n\\nRental property insurance:\\xa0Rental property insurance\\xa0is standard for landlords and bundles liability, hazard, and loss of income insurance.\\nSewer and water line backup:\\xa0Some utility/water companies might offer to include this in your monthly bill. However, it’s worth having this written into your insurance policy because if your main water or sewer line breaks, the cost to repair it can run into tens of thousands of dollars.\\nFlood insurance:\\xa0If you’re in a designated flood zone, this is an extra expense you won’t be able to let float by. (In short, don’t buy in a flood zone.)\\nLoss of income coverage:\\xa0If your apartment is rendered uninhabitable due to a natural disaster, loss of rent insurance will cover the lost rent. Some landlord policies include this as standard, but it’s optional for others. Understand, however, that loss of rent insurance does not cover a tenant’s inability to work (through illness or other) and thus not pay rent. Expect to pay around one-third to one-half of the total premium for a landlord insurance policy, so consider this carefully in your overall calculations.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTenant rent default insurance:\\xa0If you can afford this, it might help you sleep better at night. Also known as rent guarantee insurance, this insurance protects landlords from tenants who skip out on paying the rent, keeping your cash flow steady and your blood pressure low.\\nPet insurance:\\xa0Pet-friendly rental properties are in high demand, and if you want to be competitive, this is something you’ll want to offer, too. If your tenant’s pet attacks another tenant in your building or damages your apartment, you want to ensure you are covered. Ensuring your tenant has pet coverage in their renter’s insurance is one way to go about that. However, local landlord-tenant laws differ from state to state, and you’ll need to check the most cost-effective form of protecting yourself when pets are in your building.\\nUmbrella insurance:\\xa0This is often overlooked by landlords who are concerned with their bottom-line\\xa0cash flow. However, umbrella insurance can be a godsend if you have the margins. It’s secondary insurance coverage to protect you once the limits on your standard liability policy have been exceeded. It’s especially helpful should you face lawsuits, expenses related to medical attention, and lost wages.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nBeing a landlord\\xa0is fraught with potential pitfalls. You are at the mercy of the weather and human beings—two unreliable commodities. In your quest for profitability, you must pay attention to possible problems that could leave you penniless. Factoring in worst-case scenarios and ensuring you have the right insurance policy for your investments is crucial.\\xa0\\nAs you scale, you’ll need to modify your insurance. Time is the great equalizer in real estate, and staying in the game is half the battle. Should you hold on to your assets, over time, your profits will increase, so if you have to spend a little more on insurance at the cost of your cash flow in the short term, it’s wise to consider doing so to ensure you can live to fight another day and increase your profits in the long run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Is Now a Better Time to Invest in Real Estate Debt or Equity?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany investors assume that ownership is inherently safer than debt. I currently own equity in thousands of units and have invested six figures in real estate debts.\\nI can tell you firsthand that it’s not—at least not always.\\xa0\\nStill, real estate equity and debt investments serve different purposes in your portfolio. Before parsing the risks of equity versus debt investments in 2024, it’s worth reviewing the roles each plays.\\nThe Role of Debt Investments\\nMost debt investments come with a fixed interest rate. You know the return you can expect to earn, assuming the borrower performs.\\xa0\\nReal estate-related debts could be secured by a\\xa0lien\\xa0against real property. If the borrower defaults, the lender can foreclose on the property to recover the money. Or debt may not be secured with a lien but come with a personal or corporate guarantee.\\xa0\\nJust a few weeks ago, our passive real estate investing club at SparkRental invested in a 10% note secured with a lien under a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. It came with a rolling six-month term—in other words, we can each terminate our note with six months’ notice. It also came with personal and corporate guarantees from a highly successful real estate investor who owns over a hundred units and flips 30 to 50 homes each year.\\xa0\\nIs a 10% return something to write home about? Hardly, when that’s roughly the long-term average\\xa0stock market return. But unlike stocks, this note pays predictable interest every month and comes with substantial security.\\nWe’ve also invested in a 15% note, backed by a corporate guarantee from a company that owns about a dozen cash-flowing businesses. It carries more risk but pays a much higher return. (So far, they’ve paid like clockwork).\\nWhich is the better investment? Are they better than equity investments despite not offering upside potential?\\xa0\\nThese are the wrong questions. Instead, I ask how comfortable I feel with the return versus the risk and whether I currently prefer immediate income or the chance of higher returns in a few years from an equity investment.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Role of Equity Investments\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we recently invested fractionally in a 200-unit apartment complex. While it doesn’t need major value-add renovations, the syndicators are converting the units to Section 8, taking advantage of a loophole in the LIHTC rules restricting rents.\\xa0\\nThe bottom line: They’ll be able to raise rents by 50% or more. And that’s based on today’s Section 8-approved rents—it doesn’t require future rent growth.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nHowever, it will take a couple of years to replace all the rent-restricted cash tenants with Section 8 renters, so the investment won’t pay distributions for at least two years. But once the rents are stabilized, they plan to refinance the property to return investors’ capital, and then pay distributions indefinitely (one model for “infinite returns”). If the property were to sell in a few years rather than refinancing, we’d potentially be looking at 20%-40%-plus annualized returns.\\xa0\\nIn this case, we own a tiny piece of a huge property. We participate in the upside and stand to earn huge returns, but it will take a while. Is this a better or worse investment than the 10% fixed-interest note?\\xa0\\nAgain, it’s just a different investment. There’s a loan against this property, so in the event of an unforeseen catastrophe, the lender gets paid first. But we stand to earn far higher returns and potentially\\xa0cash flow\\xa0to infinity and beyond.\\xa0\\nOr you could invest in rental properties mobile home parks, or retail or vacation rentals. We’ve invested in all of these in our Co-Investing Club. We hope that the combination of appreciation and widening cash flow margins deliver 15%-plus returns in the years to come. But these investments come with downside risks as well.\\nInvesting in Debt vs. Equity in 2024\\nReal estate is not an elevator that only goes up, as far too many investors have discovered firsthand over the last 18 months.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadly speaking, I’ve seen real estate equity investments get hit much harder than debt investments. But that doesn’t mean debt investments have been risk-free, and it doesn’t mean that investments you make today will suffer the same problems as investments made two years ago.\\xa0\\nKeep these\\xa0real estate investing risk factors\\xa0in mind as you consider investing in 2024.\\xa0\\nInterest rate risk\\nThe interest rate risk investors face today is different from the risk of two years ago.\\xa0\\nTwo years ago, syndicators played fast and loose with variable interest debt and short-term\\xa0bridge loans. Interest rates have been low for decades, and they’ll stay that way forever, right?\\xa0\\nWrong. Many syndicators got caught with their pants down as rates shot through the roof. It’s caused many deals to implode, with higher loan payments creating negative cash flow.\\xa0\\nToday, the risk is more subtle. Everyone just assumes interest rates will fall later this year and throughout 2025. That might happen—or it might not.\\xa0Don’t count on interest rates\\xa0and cap rates being lower two to three years from now. That’s speculation and a little better than gambling.\\xa0\\nWord to the wise: Vet potential investments by assuming higher, not lower, interest rates and cap rates upon exit. If you plan to invest in real estate equity, look for deals financed with long-term, fixed-interest debt.\\xa0\\nAnd yes, those deals often still cash flow well, despite today’s higher rates. For example, Shaun Martin of\\xa0We Buy Houses in Denver\\xa0explains: “I recently bought a $2 million property in Golden, Colorado, and financed the whole property at a fixed 7.5% interest rate. This made sense because it still cash flowed and has plenty of potential for forced appreciation to boost equity in the near future.”\\nI believe there’s plenty of opportunity to invest in real estate equity this year. But I steer clear of investments that assume a low exit cap rate or low refinance interest rate in under three years.\\xa0\\nPinched cash flow risk\\nHistorically, cash flow was more predictable than appreciation. Rents almost never drop, while property values drop more frequently. Unfortunately, the last 18 months have showcased that “almost never” isn’t the same as “never.”\\xa0\\nIn many markets, rents have either dropped or leveled off. In many others, rents have inched upward, but not enough to keep pace with expenses.\\nInsurance premiums\\xa0and labor costs, in particular, have spiked over the last two years. If your insurance premium rises by 50% and your maintenance, repairs, and management labor costs have risen 5%, but your rents have only risen 1%, cash flow gets pinched. Or it becomes negative, transforming your asset into a liability.\\xa0\\nSure, that risk affects both real estate equity and debt investments. But it adds far more risk to equity investments, as owners are the ones coughing up money to make their loan payments each month. If the owner falls behind on loan payments, the lender has the luxury of reviewing the equity in the property and making a judgment call: Modify the loan or otherwise work with the borrower or foreclose to recover your loan amount.\\xa0\\nWhen the lender’s loan only makes up 50% to 75% of the property’s value, they tend to feel pretty secure in their investment. And sure, in a disaster scenario they might only recover 70% of the property value while having lent 75%. They take a haircut. But they don’t lose everything, like the equity owners do.\\xa0\\nWild Card: The threat of recession\\nIn late 2022, many economists and corporate banks declared a “100% chance of recession” in 2023.\\xa0\\nSpoiler alert:\\xa0It never came. In early 2024, pundits and investors seem to believe there’s a 0% chance of recession in the immediate future. That seems just as absurd as the 100% recession risk forecast.\\xa0\\nTo be clear, I’m not shouting that the sky is falling. I doubt we’ll see a recession in 2024 or early 2025. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t consider the possibility at all.\\xa0\\nA recession would create two opposing forces for real estate investments. On the downside, defaults on rents and mortgage loans would jump, as would vacancy rates and presumably foreclosure rates. Those all put downward pressure on cash flow and property values.\\xa0\\nOn the upside, JPow and company at the Federal Reserve would cut rates like they’re coeds in a slasher flick. Lower interest rates would pave the way for cheap refinances and lower cap rates after the initial panic passes.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDebt investments would see higher default risk. But the majority wouldn’t default, and they’d pay higher interest rates than new debt investments after the Fed starts slashing.\\xa0\\nEquity investments would likely see a short-term drop in property values, followed by a post-recession rebound. Here’s how home prices have fared during and after recessions over the last 60 years:\\nMedian Sales Price of Homes Sold in the U.S. (1963-2024) – St. Louis Federal Reserve\\nProperty owners with negative cash flow could potentially refinance to get back above water and survive the recession—or not.\\xa0\\nReal estate investments come with real risk, and you should never forget it.\\xa0\\nVerdict: Equity or Debt in 2024?\\n“Consider your own investing goals and risk appetite first,” suggests Annie Dickerson of\\xa0Goodegg Investments. “Use that as your guiding star, and adjust accordingly based on the greater real estate market. For example, if you typically have a fairly healthy appetite for risk and mostly invest in equity, but you see that the market is pulling back, you might consider rebalancing in the short term to incorporate more conservative debt or preferred equity investments, and vice versa.”\\nIn general, I see lower risk in real estate debt investments in 2024. Every single one of my debt investments has performed as promised over the last few years. Meanwhile, I’ve seen some equity investments struggle with negative cash flow, capital calls, and rescue capital stepping in ahead of prior investors.\\xa0\\nBut I also believe there’s an opportunity for equity investments. As some past syndication deals from 2021-2022 unravel, they can become bargains for today’s investors.\\xa0\\nWhen we vet deals as an investment club, we pay close attention to these risks I’ve outlined. We like to see longer-term, fixed-interest debts, ideally assumed from the seller. For example, we invested in a deal that assumed a 5.1% fixed-interest loan with nine years remaining. I don’t know if there will be a good market for selling within the next three years, but I’m pretty confident there will be one within the next nine.\\xa0\\nWe also look at rent versus expense forecasts. I get nervous when I see high forecast rent growth with modest insurance and labor cost growth. Instead, I prefer to see some relatively certain reason for higher rents, such as the Section 8 conversion example based on today’s rents. In a different property, the syndicator plans to split the four-bedroom units into smaller units (with a proof of concept already completed and earning higher income).\\xa0\\nFinally, how recession-resistant is the investment? We recently invested in a portfolio of four\\xa0mobile home\\xa0parks, which had 100% occupancy and a waiting list for entry. In a recession, that waiting list would only get longer.\\xa0\\nConsider debt investments for income and predictability and equity investments for long-term upside potential. Just make sure there’s a clear and conservative plan for the equity investments to survive short-term turbulence and last long enough to see lower interest rates and calmer markets.\\xa0\\nMost of all,\\xa0diversify your real estate investments.

Finding one that also fits your budget? That’s the real challenge. While our research has found that some cities are experiencing a\\xa0shift towards a buyers market, many metro areas are still largely unaffordable for the typical home buyer.\\nBut\\xa0many\\xa0metros aren’t\\xa0all\\xa0metros. We\\xa0took a close look at the top five affordable metro areas, then compared the median home prices in those places to the area’s median income. What did we find? First, we found zip codes where 100% of homes were affordable on a local salary. Then, we identified some great neighborhoods within those zip codes with cute homes and happy neighbors. From a rural oasis in the suburbs to a quiet section of mid-century homes in the middle of an urban neighborhood, these are some of the most affordable neighborhoods in the nation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nColumbus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeechwood\\nAffordable zip code:\\xa043227\\nMedian income in zip: $64,480\\nMedian home value in zip: $79,779\\nWhen a local describes a neighborhood as a “secret little spot,”1\\xa0you know you’re in for a pleasant surprise—and some affordable homes overlooked by other house-hunters.\\xa0Beechwood is just that kind of place. It’s a neighborhood filled with charming mid-century homes and huge lawns just 15 minutes from Downtown Columbus. While locals note that the average age in the neighborhood skews toward retirees, 70% of respondents to What Locals Say, our database of insight from real residents, state that kids can be seen playing outside. That makes for a nice residential blend of quiet and cuteness.\\nThough there is a busy shopping strip to the east of the neighborhood on South Hamilton Road, the residential streets of Beechwood insulate you from traffic and noise. Yet you’re not so far that you’re in for a long commute. In addition to its proximity to downtown, Beechwood is less than a 15-minute drive the John Glenn Columbus International Airport, making future vacations and business trips a breeze.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Beechwood\\n Show me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPittsburgh\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomeacre-Lyndora\\nAffordable zip code:\\xa016045\\nMedian income in zip: $59,000\\nMedian home value in zip: $88,450\\nEncompassing an area that surrounds a corner of the historic city of\\xa0Butler, Pennsylvania,\\xa0Homeacre-Lyndora is where you’ll find all the comforts and conveniences a family could want. While the 16045 zip code where 100% of the homes are affordable for the local median income only includes Lyndora, at the southern end of Homeacre-Lyndora, the community functions as one neighborhood. And with a few pricey exceptions, the whole area is pretty affordable.\\nMost of your shopping and restaurants are located on one big stretch of New Castle Road, making Saturday errands a breeze. Need to entertain the kids? Head just off that road to the unusually nice Alameda Park Pool (it’s huge and has a water playground) or the Family Bowlaway Fun Center. Though these features might point to a suburban lifestyle, you won’t find cookie-cutter developments here. Locals call out the peaceful country atmosphere, and the homes in the area have a quaint character all their own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Homeacre-Lyndora\\n Show me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSt. Louis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoutheast side of\\xa0Florissant\\nAffordable zip code:\\xa063033\\nMedian income in zip: $60,900\\nMedian home value in zip: $112,142\\nIf you love to golf but also want to remain close to the city, Florissant might just be a great fit for you. It’s less than a 30-minute drive from downtown\\xa0St. Louis, has plenty of food and shopping, and has two big golf courses located right in the neighborhood (Florissant City Golf Course and Eagle Springs Golf Course).\\nThe Florissant zip code with the most affordable homes, 63033, also includes a bit of the town of Black Jack. You’ll be located right between the two golf courses there. Plus, this area also has some of the bigger houses, making your dollar go further. “I have lived here for two years now and I love it,” says one Black Jack resident. “People are friendly and really look out for each other.”2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Florissant\\n Show me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndianapolis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeedway\\nAffordable zip code:\\xa046224\\nMedian income in zip: $60,000\\nMedian home value in zip: $91,751\\nFrom the name alone, you might think that\\xa0Speedway would be a fast-paced city. In reality, that idea is both true and false. It’s actually an old-fashioned town that just happens to be the home of the highest-capacity sports venue in the world—Indianapolis Motor Speedway. That’s right—the racetrack seats more than 250,000 people, meaning the entire population of small-town Speedway would fill just 5% of the place.\\nLocals describe Speedway as a small town within a city, and while you will need a car, you also can enjoy getting around on the roomy sidewalks. It’s an enjoyable walk, too: The homes have a quaint charm and neatly manicured lawns. Residents recommend going to the newly revitalized N.

From the woodlands of Hidden Valley Park to the winding hiking paths of the Buckeye Greenway (and the sports fields and rec options in between), nature still has a place near the city in this neighborhood.\\nOften, you’ll also find a woodsy vibe in many of the backyards of the homes here, which range from cute cottages to newly-updated ranches.

Homes were considered affordable if 30% or less of the metro’s median monthly income was required to afford a mortgage payment and other expenses, including property taxes, on that home.\\nIn order to find the share of affordable homes on the market, we calculated the maximum amount that the median income could allocate towards a mortgage payment. We evaluated the value of each home, subtracted a 20% down payment and calculated the monthly mortgage payment using the prevailing 30-year fixed mortgage rate (according to Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey). We also factored in mortgage insurance and property taxes. Based on these calculations, we determined the share of homes that were affordable without exceeding 30% of the median monthly income for that metro. Median household income is based on the U.S. Census’ 2017 1-Year American Community Survey.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\xa0Lori, 2014,\\xa0“This secret little spot in Columbus was built in the 60’s.

Our most-viewed properties in July include several stunning homes that are asking eight or nine figures. But even the most palatial estate needs a top-quality neighborhood to seal the deal. So we took a look at July’s most popular homes to get the rundown on the neighborhood with an assist from\\xa0What Locals Say, our guide to residents’ insights on their own communities.\\nEnjoy browsing these big summer dreams—and the very reasonable buys mixed in here, too.\\nFlatiron District, New York\\n$98,000,000\\nHow many fireplaces can fit in one home? This place tests the limits. See more photos here.\\nNamed for one of\\xa0New York City‘s early skyscrapers, the\\xa0Flatiron District\\xa0in Manhattan is home to lots of publishers and ad agencies and is also part of the city’s “Silicon Alley” tech business district. Major attractions range from the popular Italian food hall Eataly to Teddy Roosevelt’s birthplace. But despite the bustle, the Flatiron District is also an in-demand residential area, as notable residents like Chelsea Clinton can testify. What Locals Say users describe the neighborhood is just an all-around nice place. “There are parks and schools in the immediate area as well as plenty of fun stores and galleries and movie theaters,” one resident says.1\\nAvailable now in the Flatiron District,\\xa0this extravagant penthouse suite\\xa0is 19,000 square feet. With 11 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and truly grand views of the city from its 4,500 square feet of terrace, NYC living doesn’t get much more luxurious than this.\\n\\nHearthstone, Yonkers\\n$399,000\\nWood beams on the ceiling are always a plus. See more photos here.\\nOne resident of Yonkers’\\xa0Hearthstone\\xa0neighborhood describes the place as “centrally located to all”—including Yonkers itself and the Big Apple, just 45 minutes away by train.2\\xa0Neighborhood restaurants are wildly diverse, featuring Filipino, Korean, Mexican, and Italian cuisines. Residents also enjoy a variety of local groceries, including the fish market and restaurant at Highridge Fishery Seafood, described by one Yelp reviewer as “Yonkers’ best-kept secret.” If you’re seeking entertainment, the Alamo Drafthouse is an upscale movie theater, and for the outdoorsy, nearby Sprain Ridge Park has 278 acres of natural beauty to explore.\\nAvailable now in Hearthstone, this\\xa0charming Cape Cod\\xa0is the epitome of cozy living. It packs a lot into its small footprint, including three bedrooms, a bathroom, plenty of storage space, and a finished basement. We also love the little deck for summertime relaxation.\\n\\nBel Air, Los Angeles\\n$195,000,000\\nThe hedge maze will make you feel like you’re in a Jane Austen novel. See\\xa0more photos here.\\nBel Air\\xa0is the stuff of pop-culture legend, thanks to the TV shows set or shot there and the stars, from Jennifer Aniston to Alfred Hitchcock, who’ve called it home. But if you look beyond the big names, big houses, and big reputation, you’ll find neighbors who enjoy a quiet area with abundant natural beauty. “We are surrounded by nature: trees, flowers, birds, butterflies,” says one resident on What Locals Say.3\\xa0Right in the neighborhood, Getty View Park is an ideal place to enjoy some of that beauty (and take in a great view of\\xa0L.A.). And, as you would expect, there’s chic dining and shopping in the area if you don’t feel like venturing out into the rest of L.A.\\nAvailable now in Bel Air is the\\xa010-acre Chartwell estate. All told, the property has 11 bedrooms and 18 bathrooms, as well as a 40-vehicle car gallery and a 12,000-bottle wine cellar. And the gardens and L.A. views are downright magical.\\n\\nBeverly Glen, Los Angeles\\n$150,000,000\\nA barber chair comes in the bathroom, but it’s BYO barber. See more photos here.\\nOne resident of\\xa0L.A.‘s\\xa0Beverly Glen\\xa0neighborhood describes it as, “Beautiful, quiet and unique. Feels far away from the city but is close to everything.”4\\xa0The small community is tucked between two of the area’s most prestigious neighborhoods, Beverly Hills and Hollywood Hills, and also has easy access to Westwood and Hollywood. Despite its exclusive address, Beverly Glen has a very close-knit community feel. There’s little retail in the area, but Glen Market is a beloved local grocery. And neighbors look forward to annual community events like the Garden Walk and Glen Fair, with music, dancing, food, and kids’ activities.\\nAvailable now in Beverly Glen,\\xa0this luxury home is ideal for anyone who loves soaking up the sun and 270-degree views of L.A. And its 38,000-square-foot interior is worth a peek too, with gorgeously designed spaces including—get this—a candy room, a movie theater, and three gourmet kitchens.\\n\\nSoundview, The Bronx\\n$649,999\\nPeek inside to see the reading nook under a window. See more photos here.\\nJust north of the confluence of the Bronx and East rivers,\\xa0Soundview\\xa0is a working-class community with culture to spare. According to\\xa0AM New York, “Bronx\\xa0residents frequent Soundview for two things: Food and music.” It’s easy to see why. The local dining scene has Mexican, Caribbean, and Spanish restaurants—although a single cuisine isn’t enough for local institution Joe’s Place, which proudly “offers three distinct dining atmospheres” under the same roof. Joe’s is also a neighborhood music venue, as is Soundview Park, which hosts summer concerts on the waterfront. “Just nice and calm. No drama,” says one local. “I love living in this area.”5\\nAvailable now in Soundview, this\\xa0two-family home\\xa0has been well maintained and beautifully renovated. The hardwood floors and stone shower walls lend a contemporary elegance, and the small back deck is a great place to relax outdoors even in the heart of the city.\\n\\nBensonhurst, Brooklyn\\n$695,000\\nA leaded glass door and wrought iron railings? Yes, please. See more photos here.\\nThe\\xa0Bensonhurst\\xa0neighborhood is known as the biggest of\\xa0Brooklyn‘s multiple “Little Italies” but also as one of the borough’s Chinatowns. The area bustles with sushi bars, innumerable local groceries, nightclubs, and cafes. And with plenty of subway stations in the neighborhood, Manhattan is just 45 minutes away. One lifetime Bensonhurst resident says she’s “seen many changes, but it’s still a safe place to live with great neighbors, shopping, and transportation.”6\\nAvailable now in Bensonhurst, this\\xa0three-bedroom home has both new and old touches.

These beach communities are less than an hour from downtown. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s that sunny time of year when you end up spending half your workday staring out your office window wondering when your next chance to hit the beach will be. What if the answer was “right after work” every single day—right outside your door?\\nAffordable beachfront living does exist, even within commuting distance of pricey cities. We found five beach communities within an hour’s rush-hour commute of major metro centers, all of which have median home prices lower than the city’s. So go ahead and live the sunny, sandy dream. Your at-home beach is waiting.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork in:\\xa0Chicago\\nLive in:\\xa0South Chicago\\nChicago median sale price: $277,500\\nSouth Chicago median sale price: $91,000\\nCommute time: 45 mins\\n\\nAt\\xa0South Chicago’s sprawling 142-acre Rainbow Beach Park, you can soak up the sun and enjoy an impressive view of the Chicago skyline at the same time. That skyline isn’t far away, either—it’s as short as a 45-minute commute to the Loop via public transit. Historically the heart of the city’s steel industry, South Chicago remains a working-class neighborhood today, with a median sale price for homes at $91,000—far below the citywide median of $277,500. Back in its industrial days, neighborhood steel mills stood on the lakefront, but today, the area is under redevelopment, with Steelworkers Natural Area and Steelworkers Park giving residents renewed access to the water where factories once stood.\\nOne user of our\\xa0What Locals Say\\xa0neighborhood guide describes the community as “clean” and “convenient.”1\\xa0In the summer, the beach gets bumpin’ with DJ sets and the Make Music Chicago DIY music festival.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork in:\\xa0Boston\\nLive in:\\xa0North Quincy\\nBoston median sale price: $885,000\\nNorth Quincy median sale price: $455,500\\nCommute time: 22 minutes\\n\\nBoston\\xa0is visible from the beach and just 22 minutes away on the T from the\\xa0North Quincy\\xa0neighborhood of\\xa0Quincy, Massachusetts. Forming a narrow, 2.3-mile strip along the northeastern edge of the North Quincy, Wollaston Beach is the largest beach in Boston Harbor. A jogging and biking path runs the length of the beach, and it’s also home to two yacht clubs.\\nSounds fancy, but with a median sale price of $455,500 (nearly half of Boston’s $885,000 median), it’s a more affordable alternative to the city no matter if you’re into the beach life or not. What’s more, one resident says, “there are so many amazing walking restaurants within walking distance.”2\\xa0Try The Clam Box or Tony’s Clam Shack, both directly across Quincy Shore Drive from the beach, for some fresh-caught seafood goodness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork in:\\xa0San Francisco\\nLive in:\\xa0Daly City\\nSan Francisco median sale price:\\xa0$1,400,000\\nDaly City median sale price: $944,000\\nCommute time: 15 minutes\\n\\nJust 15 minutes south of\\xa0San Francisco\\xa0by car or rail,\\xa0Daly City\\xa0has three different beaches, which are loved by nearby locals for their views and unique personalities. Mussel Rock Park Beach is known for its paragliding activity and rocky trails, Phillip Burton Memorial Beach for its large cave, and Thornton State Beach for the equestrian trails that connect to the waterfront.\\nDaly City’s median sales price of $944,000 may seem hardly a bargain, but it remains nearly half a million lower than San Francisco’s median of $1,400,000. And, surprisingly, the beaches here aren’t that well-known beyond Daly City locals. Local news source SFGate says it’s hard to believe Mussel Rock’s coastal lookout, rock formations, and miles of beach “could get overlooked by so many people.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork in:\\xa0Washington, D.C.\\nLive in:\\xa0Edgewater\\nWashington, D.C. median sale price: $585,000\\nEdgewater median sale price: $386,250\\nCommute time: 50 minutes\\n\\nLess than an hour’s commute from the metropolis of\\xa0Washington, D.C., Beverly Triton Beach in\\xa0Edgewater, Maryland, is both stunning and serene. And the median sale price of $386,250 in Edgewater is well below D.C.’s $585,000 to boot. With a chill pace and fewer than 10,000 residents, it’s a whole different world from the frenzied Capital. “Anything you need is within walking or short driving distance,” says one resident.3\\nThe local beach sets the tone. It’s part of the larger Beverly Triton Nature Park, with about five miles of nature trails where visitors report seeing everything from osprey to crabs. And while Beverly Triton may be the community’s biggest beach, it’s not the only one. Woodland Beach also includes a small strip of sand, and nearby Quiet Waters Park has a dog beach in case you have hounds who want to get in on the fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork in:\\xa0New York City\\nLive in:\\xa0Midland Beach\\nNew York City median sale price: $1,250,000\\nMidland Beach median sale price: $507,500\\nCommute time: 40 minutes\\n\\nStaten Island‘s Midland Beach is a hub of activity in the summertime. Franklin D. Roosevelt Boardwalk, which runs the length of the beach, is packed with joggers and cyclists, while sunbathers catch rays on the sand. At night you can see the regular fireworks displays from neighboring South Beach, which also hosts concerts and other special events. And youngsters are sure to love running through the turtle-shaped fountain. Although\\xa0Midland Beach is a 45-minute drive from New York City, its median sale price is $507,500—well below the Big Apple’s median of $1,250,000.\\nThe beach neighborhood has something else that’s hard to come by in the big city: small-town connection. One local who has lived in Midland Beach for two decades says, “We know everyone, which we’ve\\xa0found makes living here so much more enjoyable.”4\\xa0Once well-known as a resort town, Midland Beach is no longer a tourist attraction, but its restaurants, parks, and namesake waterfront still give it the feel of being on vacation without leaving home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to find a home that’ll make your summer perfect?

      "{'title': 'These neighborhoods are on sale', 'context': 'These neighborhoods are on sale\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHome buyers, things are moving in your direction—in these neighborhoods especially.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the high prices and fast pace of the long-running seller’s market have delayed your home-buying plans, we’ve got good news: there are signs that a little relief is on the way. According to our research, there’s a national trend towards price cuts, homes selling below asking, and homes staying on the market a little longer than breakneck speed.\\nThough we found that the market is shifting in favor of buyers in 50 out of the 100 largest metros (a tenfold increase compared to a year ago), there are some caveats. For one, “shifting” does not mean a market has completely shifted in favor of buyers—just that there are some signs of change. And even where it’s present, the trend isn’t metro-wide. The shift away from a seller’s market varies greatly by neighborhood, and it doesn’t always mean lower prices.\\nFor example, in\\xa0Atlanta,\\xa0some ZIP codes saw days on the market increase by 12.1% and had a median home value of $299,400. But other ZIP codes had days on the market decrease by 12.7%, but had a lower median home value of $227,800. This data also supports another finding from our research, which is that more expensive neighborhoods had the more noticeable shift towards a buyers market.\\nWhat’s the takeaway? To find the best markets for home buyers right now, you’ve got to look neighborhood by neighborhood. Curious about which ones are starting to give buyers an advantage? Here are six standout ZIP codes that are “on sale” now in major metro areas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCentral Colorado Springs\\nMetro:\\xa0Colorado Springs\\nZIP on sale:\\xa080903\\nMEDIAN HOME VALUE: $273,200\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 2\\nFor a city with a lot of new development,\\xa0Central Colorado Springs\\xa0has a lot of old in it—in a good way. One of the first neighborhoods established in\\xa0Colorado Springs, you’ll see plenty of cute vintage homes and wide streets that create a charming atmosphere.\\nBut as a college town and busy downtown area, it’s not a sleepy section of the city. There’s plenty to do, whether you’re (literally) hanging out at CityROCK, an indoor rock climbing gym, or meeting up with friends at Phantom Canyon Brewing Company, a three-story microbrewery that has an unexpectedly strong billiards scene. Like other neighborhoods in the area, 85% of residents said that a car is needed in our What Locals Say survey, but downtown is still very walkable with all the restaurants and entertainment options clustered around North Tejon St. And if you’re serious about fitness, clear your plans in July when the entire area becomes the setting for the Rocky Mountain Games, the state’s largest sports festival that has events for all ages and athletic levels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Central Colorado Springs\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTule Springs\\nMetro:\\xa0Las Vegas\\nZIP on sale:\\xa089143\\nMEDIAN HOME VALUE: $295,900\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 18\\nThis desert city went from the third-worst market for buyers to the fifth-best—in just one year. Buyers also have the luxury of time to carefully consider their purchase in certain neighborhoods, like\\xa0Tule Springs, where the average number of days on the market in 2019 increased by 41.9% over 2018.\\nLocated 20 miles from the famous Las Vegas Strip, this largely-residential neighborhood is an oasis where parks both big and small might just outnumber shopping options. The biggest is the 2,040-acre\\xa0Floyd Lamb Park, home to green lawns, shade trees, roaming peacocks, and the Las Vegas Farmer’s Market. You don’t have to go out of your way to enjoy the outdoor fun, thanks to many tinier parks found throughout the neighborhood, like petite Radiant Ruby Park, an unexpected stretch of green lawn with a popular playground located right in the middle of a residential block. With a park seemingly around every corner, it’s no wonder that 93% of What Locals Say respondents\\xa0describe the neighborhood\\xa0as dog-friendly and 66% report seeing kids playing outside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Tule Springs, Las Vegas\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOak Island, North Carolina\\nMetro:\\xa0Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\\nZIP on sale:\\xa028465\\nMEDIAN SALE PRICE: $265,000\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 6.5\\nThe Myrtle Beach metro area has converted an increasing number of visitors into full-time residents who fell in love with the laid-back, beach-town atmosphere. In other words, many neighborhoods close to the beach are feeling more crowded, especially once you factor in seasonal tourists. But while\\xa0Oak Island\\xa0is also a popular destination for tourists, there’s just more room to spread out—there are 10 miles of beaches to enjoy, plus a wide range of recreation options (kayaking, fishing) on the “other side” of the island that borders the Intracoastal Waterway.\\nLocals highlight\\xa0the scenic walkways on 9th St SE, and 20th and 21st, but the real asset here is the sense of community, with another local noting how neighbors watch out for each other there. They even watch out for the endangered sea turtles who nest on the shore (a local volunteer group oversees their comings and goings). With homes averaging 112.5 days on the market—a 6.1% increase over last year—you can enjoy a vacation to your new neighborhood to try before you buy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Oak Island, North Carolina\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSanta Teresa\\nMetro:\\xa0San Jose\\nZIP on sale:\\xa095138\\nMEDIAN HOME VALUE: $1,229,900\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 28\\nThe Silicon Valley area has been an especially hot market since the tech sector took over, but\\xa0Santa Teresa\\xa0points to signs of a shift. Here, homes are still pricey, but they’re also staying on the market for a longer time (69.5 days, in fact, a 67.5% increase over last year).\\nIt’s also a rare neighborhood in this metro that actually feels like a neighborhood. What makes Santa Teresa so special comes down to one big thing highlighted again and again by locals: walkability. You can walk to shopping, the grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants. And maybe even work, too; there are a few info system companies located in the neighborhood, and you could also walk to the light rail off of Santa Teresa Blvd. for even more employment options. It takes you up to Santa Clara, where you can then pick up a light rail into Mountain View. On your way, you’ll likely encounter plenty of dogs (91% say it’s dog-friendly) and their owners, so it’s easy to strike up a conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Santa Teresa, San Jose\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelltown\\nMetro:\\xa0Seattle\\nZIP on sale:\\xa098121\\nMEDIAN HOME VALUE: $634,500\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 34.5\\nWhile sellers across\\xa0Seattle\\xa0have seen their home values increase 81.4% over the past six years, the share of listings with price cuts doubled from last year (6.2% to 13.9%). The neighborhood of\\xa0Belltown\\xa0also illustrates a citywide trend towards homes staying on the market longer. Here, the average listing is on the market for 73 days, a 77.5% increase year over year.\\nThat extra time gives you a few days to get to know the perks of living in Belltown. For one, it’s a culinary heaven with an interesting restaurant on every block on 1st and 2nd Aves in Belltown, where you can satisfy any craving from New York pizza to Brazilian rodizio (all-you-can-eat steak). Though it’s just north of the tourist-magnet of Pike Place, vacationers tend to stick to the waterfront (specifically, the Bell Street Cruise Terminal and Olympic Sculpture Park) or pass through on their way to the Space Needle, just to the north. This means your neighborhood has that “locals only” vibe, especially at night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Belltown, Seattle\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLincoln Village West\\nMetro:\\xa0Stockton, California\\nZIP on sale:\\xa095219\\nMEDIAN HOME VALUE: $395,400\\nINCREASE IN MEDIAN DAYS ON MARKET: 40.5\\nLincoln Village West\\xa0is located in a ZIP that has seen one of the most noticeable shifts in terms of days a listing stays on the market. Homes now say on the market a median of 100 days, a 68.1% increase year over year.\\nThat’ll give you plenty of time to find just the right place to kick back and relax in\\xa0Stockton. Lincoln Village West is proof that you don’t have to live on the coast to enjoy boating and fishing whenever you please. The Village West Marina and Resort is where you can sail away a beautiful day whenever you please via the San Joaquin River and Stockton Deep Water Channel (which will take you to San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean). If you’re really serious about waterfront access whenever you please, look to the homes situated around the private lakes of Lake Lincoln and North Lake. However, even if you don’t live near the water, you’ll still enjoy a quiet atmosphere no matter where you go in this neighborhood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee homes in Lincoln Village West, Stockton\\n Show Me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethodology\\nWe quantified the degree to which areas are shifting towards buyers or sellers using three input metrics:\\n\\nPercentage of listings with a price cut: The percentage of current for-sale listings with a price cut during the month.\\nMedian days on market, list-to-sale: The median days on market of homes sold within a given month, including foreclosure re-sales.\\nMedian sale-to-list price ratio: The median of the ratio between the sale price and the list price for all homes (e.g. if a home with a list price of $200k sells for $250k, its ratio would be 5:4, or 1.25)\\n\\nThe days on market and sale-to-list ratio used in the calculation are three-month rolling averages. Further detail can be found\\xa0here.\\nMedian home values are based on the Zillow Home Value Index.\\nAffordability is measured using the Price-to-Income Ratio published on Zillow’s data page.\\nTo get a better sense of how the three market components that we used to are playing out in relation to home values, we ran several fixed effects regression models (using metro areas as the fixed effects) These regressions considered only zip codes in the 100 largest metro areas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfacebook\\nCreated with Sketch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwitter\\nCreated with Sketch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail\\nCreated with Sketch.'}\n",
      "{'title': 'What to do when you have problem neighbors', 'context': \"What to do when you have problem neighbors\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDealing with bad neighbors is a delicate business. Here's how to improve things on the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiguring out how to deal with bad neighbors can be a major struggle. There’s nothing worse than\\xa0buying a house\\xa0and then realizing you have nightmare neighbors. But you don’t just have to grin and bear your neighbors’ undesirable behavior or tension on the block. With the right approach, you can turn it into an opportunity to build a good relationship, create a more positive environment for you and the rest of your\\xa0neighborhood.\\nHere’s how to deal with bad neighbors\\nFirst off, make sure you’re not the bad neighbor.\\nIt’s easy to see what your neighbor is doing to drive you nuts, but it’s a little harder to understand how your behavior might be affecting them. Because you’ll never get a neighbor to shape up if they think you’re the problem, make sure you’re as close to a model\\xa0homeowner\\xa0as possible before approaching them. A few hard questions to ask yourself:\\n\\nWhat’s your noise level like? Loud TV, music, or machinery can drive neighbors bananas any time of day. And even normal noise, from say, lawn mowing, shouldn’t be waking them up in the morning or preventing them from enjoying a peaceful evening.\\nAre your pets quiet and friendly? Noisy, threatening, or roaming dogs — and even roaming cats — can become a sore spot for neighbors.\\nDo you keep things tidy? If your lawn is overgrown or your kids’ toys are strewn all over the place, it can become an eyesore. Neighbors may start to worry about your poor\\xa0home maintenance\\xa0hurting their home value.\\nDo you respect property lines? Don’t let your trees, fences, or any other property encroach on a property line, unless your neighbors specifically say they’re fine with it. It may seem fussy, but it can prevent all sorts of disputes.\\nAre you playing tit-for-tat? If you started parking over the property line because their dog barks too much, you’ll never sort out who was really in the wrong — or find a solution. Revenge, no matter how minor, is never successful at dealing with bad neighbors.\\n\\nOnce you’re confident that you’re not\\xa0engaging in any\\xa0bad-neighbor behavior, you can approach your neighbor to talk about what’s bothering you.\\nDevelop a friendly relationship.\\nTrulia’s Neighbor Survey\\xa0showed that one in two Americans doesn’t even know the names of their neighbors — and that can be a major hindrance to resolving conflicts peacefully. Introduce yourself at the first opportunity so that you have a strong rapport to build upon if a problem arises. It will be a lot harder for your neighbor to keep causing you grief if they see you as a friendly face.\\nTo start a pattern of good communication, tell your neighbor in advance any time you’re having a party,\\xa0doing a renovation, or anything else that could create noise or commotion.\\nAssume good intentions.\\nDon’t go in guns blazing when you approach a neighbor about what’s bugging you. Drop by and approach the subject in a friendly fashion, or, should you need to gently escalate the situation, request that they meet you for coffee. That will indicate that the issue is a big deal to you.\\nNeighbors often don’t realize that they’re creating a problem, and it’s best to avoid seeming like you’re accusing them. Put yourself in their shoes, and start by assuming that their problematic behavior is not because of any ill will towards you.\\nBe sympathetic if your neighbor complains.\\nWhile it’s important to bring up problems to your neighbor in a constructive way, it’s just as crucial to be thoughtful and cooperative when you’re the one accused of poor behavior. The complaint may not make much sense to you — for example, leaves from a tree on your property falling into your neighbor’s yard. But it’s more important to be friendly and accommodating than to be “right.” Respond to any complaints or requests the way you’d like them to respond to yours. If you’re willing to try to make their lives better, they’ll be more likely to do the same for you.\\nDocument everything, just in case.\\nWith luck, you won’t ever need to involve a third-party when sorting out how to deal with bad neighbors, but it’s always possible. While it’s worth doing everything you can to resolve an issue peacefully and willingly, you should also document every step along the way just in case. On the off chance that you need to involve a homeowner association (HOA), a neighborhood group, the city building department, or even the local police or an attorney, maintain a record of relevant dates, times, emails, texts, and even photos, so the facts are at your fingertips if you need them.\\nResearch the rules before taking action.\\nBefore turning your complaint into legal action or a formal complaint, make sure you know what you’re talking about. Contact the local housing department, consult a lawyer, talk to your HOA, or just do some solid Googling to get a sense of what the neighborhood rules and the law have to say about your issue. You want to make sure you’re on the right side of things before making a big deal out of i. (For one of the most common neighbor problems, check out\\xa0this handy guide to easements.) Then — again, in a gentle and friendly way — you can let your neighbor know that the law or rules are on your side.\\nFor critical issues, contact the authorities.\\nOf course, friendly conversations don’t always fix everything, even if you’re in the right. If you’ve tried everything else and the problem neighbors haven’t stopped their offending behavior, it may be time to get the authorities involved. Just make sure you consult the right authority about the issue — and always make the police your last stop. For instance, an issue with trash all over someone’s lawn can probably be resolved with the city’s code enforcement department. And a noisy or frequently loose dog might warrant a call to your HOA before the police or animal control.\\nAvoid scenarios likely to cause conflict.\\nSome situations between neighbors are almost guaranteed to cause conflict — for example, buying a home next to one\\xa0that shows signs of\\xa0being a hoarder house\\xa0or\\xa0one with\\xa0a shared\\xa0driveway. No matter how likable your neighbors may seem, tensions are likely to rise in situations like this. So unless you know your neighbor extremely well, it’s best to avoid the possibility entirely.\\nFind out what homes are available in the friendliest neighborhood you know on\\xa0Trulia.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfacebook\\nCreated with Sketch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntwitter\\nCreated with Sketch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail\\nCreated with Sketch.\"}\n"

      "Have you thought about becoming a property manager, but want to know what the property manager role actually entails? What are the responsibilities of a property manager?\n",
      "Read on if you are contemplating pursuing a property management career. We hope the list of responsibilities below will help you decide if this career is for you.\n",
      "What Does a Property Manager Do?\n",
      "In general, a property manager is hired when the landlord or real estate investor wants to outsource some or all of the daily responsibilities of their rental property. Property manager responsibilities can, indeed, include a few basic tasks or you might be responsible for entire operations at the property. We list below 10 common property manager responsibilities.\n",
      "1. Finding New Tenants\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities usually include tenant management. This is the main responsibility of landlords and many are happy to outsource this to property managers. Tenant management often includes finding and attracting tenants. Residential property managers are expected to fill vacant rental units at the property. Marketing a rental property, therefore, is part of the job description. They will need to advertise the rentals and post compelling ads to relevant listing sites and other places for advertising rentals.\n",
      "2. Tenant Screening\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities also include making sure that new prospective tenants are trustworthy. Here, professional property managers often have a specific tenant screening process that goes through the prospective tenants’ credit history and backgrounds. The good thing here is that the more people they screen over time, the better and faster they can pick the right tenants and avoid frequent tenant turnover.\n",
      "3. Handling Complaints\n",
      "Maintenance and handling complaints are also common property management responsibilities. For example, if someone is having frequent parties at the property and the neighbors complain about it, it will likely be the property manager who will have to deal with it. Sometimes property managers even have to handle emergency situations, so you should also be aware of the safety precautions taken at the property.\n",
      "4. Coordinating Tenant Turnover\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities include the coordination of tenant turnover. Indeed, property managers are the ones who need to coordinate when people move in and out. Property managers will need to check the rental spaces after previous tenants for damages, organize cleaning, and fix any damages before new tenants move in.\n",
      "In some cases where tenants cause problems, the property manager handles the evictions. This means they should know the landlord-tenant laws as well as have the courage to handle the situation confidently.\n",
      "5. Setting, Collecting, and Adjusting Rents\n",
      "Collecting rent is a basic responsibility of any landlord. Property manager responsibilities, therefore, can also include lease management as this task landlords gladly outsource to property managers. The property manager will also usually define and set up systems for collecting rent from tenants. They will often have to include strict deadlines and penalties for late payments, and a method to check all rents have been paid as agreed.\n",
      "The property manager is not only in charge of collecting the rents but is also usually responsible for setting a rental rate. This requires that they actually know the market. A property manager must adjust the rents in a way that attracts tenants but also generates rental income for the owners. Likewise, the property manager can also increase or lower rent annually based on the developments in the real estate market.\n",
      "6. Property Maintenance\n",
      "\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities also include property maintenance. This will ensure the property stays in good condition and is a safe environment for the tenants. Maintenance means investigating and resolving tenant complaints and enforcing rules of occupancy. They will also check all the vacant apartments and maintain and renovate them as needed or coordinate the work of contractors. Do note that in colder locations, basic maintenance can even include contracting snow removal services.\n",
      "7. Securing the Property\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities often go beyond basic maintenance at the rental property. They will also need to secure the property by either contracting security guards or maintaining proper security devices or both. Their role will also include setting up policies and procedures that build emergency preparedness. A professional property manager knows that the more secure the rental property is, the more sense of security the tenants feel. This improves tenant retention.\n",
      "8. Overall Supervision \n",
      "The responsibilities of a property manager and their role can often be a lot more than meets the eye. Yes, property manager responsibilities do include the more visible day-to-day errands and services, but in the background, they can, in fact, run the entire show. That is if the real estate investor wants to utilize the whole spectrum of property management support available out there. Property managers can be requested to carry out all the analysis, planning, and management of the property. To this end, they do need a wide set of management skills and knowledge of the real estate domain.\n",
      "If there are other employees working in the rental property, for example, security guards, property manager duties include supervising their work. This includes setting their salaries and evaluating their performance. Property managers will also supervise other potential contractors at the property.\n",
      "9. Financial Management\n",
      "For a residential property manager, financial management starts from analyzing and establishing the right rental rates, calculating costs, depreciation, and taxes as well as determining realistic profit goals and a budget to achieve them. On top of planning, a property manager is also expected to accomplish financial objectives. To this end, they collect rents and pay invoices, monitor variances, and take corrective action to get the budget back on track.\n",
      "10. Staying Up-to-Date and Enforcing Landlord-Tenant Laws\n",
      "Professional property managers must have in-depth knowledge of local landlord-tenant laws in terms of screening tenants, handling security deposits, lease terminations, and evictions, as well as compliance with property safety standards. They will have to enforce these and all the policies laid out in the lease contracts. This can also include confronting potential violators.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "We hope this list of common property manager responsibilities provided you a better understanding of what is expected of this role. As you probably noticed, property manager responsibilities can include only a few essential tasks or include entire management of the rental property. It is safe to say that property managers need to acquire various skills and knowledge for managing rental properties successfully.

      "Should you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\n",
      "With interest rates rising over the last year, it has made it tougher and tougher for real estate investors and owner-occupied home buyers. People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don’t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \n",
      "Have high rates caused property values to decline?\n",
      "There are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \n",
      "We have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "High rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\n",
      "I think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \n",
      "Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn’t mean that properties can’t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \n",
      "What kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \n",
      "Can you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \n",
      "Do you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don’t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn’t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \n",
      "Are you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will rates go down allowing a refinance?\n",
      "I believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \n",
      "No one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "If you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \n",

      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welcome to The Top Floor, the real estate management podcast that’s dedicated to keeping you one step ahead of industry trends with expert advice and actionable insights. I’m your host, Megan Eales Monroe. Together, we’ll dig deep with today’s property management leaders and industry change-makers to help you unlock new possibilities, transform your day-to-day operations, and grow your business. And, no matter the size or type of real estate portfolio you manage, we’ve got you covered here on The Top Floor.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The topic of artificial intelligence may not be new to our conversations on The Top Floor. But today, we’re diving into AI from a completely different perspective.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the span of just over one year, the world’s perception of generative AI has undergone a dramatic transformation. What once seemed novel and futuristic is now recognized across virtually every industry — including real estate — as a necessity for the very near future.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, even with AI’s transformation from science fiction to the real world, the technology is advancing at such an astounding pace that trying to stay ahead of AI can leave most organizations feeling like they’re consistently one step behind. And that’s exactly why we’re chatting with Zack Kass today.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack is a futurist, keynote speaker, consultant, and the former Head of Go-To-Market at OpenAI, the organization behind ChatGPT. He’s also been working in the AI industry since 2010. Because his mission is to demystify AI, help business leaders navigate the rapidly evolving environment, and ensure organizations are active participants in their AI-powered future, our conversation today will focus on the current state of AI and how to use it to future-proof your organization.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack, thank you so much for joining us on The Top Floor today. Before we dive in, in case any of our listeners aren’t familiar with your background, could you please tell us a little bit about yourself?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure. Yeah, Megan, thanks so much for having me. I’m Zack Kass. I’ve been in AI for 14 years. Today I spend most of my time trying to prepare the world for AGI. So artificial general intelligence is the theory that eventually AI will achieve human intellectual equivalence. And my time at OpenAI, and also the rest of my 14-year journey in AI, built this fascination, but also a deep, deep obsession with AGI and our socioeconomic/political preparation for it.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you share a little bit about how you first came to be interested in AI?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became interested in AI mostly because I got a job in it. I wasn’t particularly concerned with how I was employed in 2010. The market was not good and I was willing to take any job I could get, and I got hired at a company called CrowdFlower, which became Figure Eight, which was a machine learning company. That, of course, led me eventually to OpenAI after many years in the industry. But I can’t say that I was initially fascinated with AI. I think I developed a fascination once I was introduced to the industry.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that makes sense. And especially with a technology like AI, once you see all of the applications that it has, and like you’ve mentioned, the incredible capacity that it has to change how we get work done in the future. So that makes sense. So we would love to hear a little bit about how you came to be a futurist out of that journey.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. The term futurist is a broad, somewhat self-referential term, but my work now is spent entirely helping governments, corporations, and general population prepare for this new future. And what we basically know is that we’ve begun this incredible ascension as a human species. That means that for… Whereas most of the human experience, we could predict the next thousand years pretty well. Then it became the next 100 years. Now it’s barely the next 10. And that means a lot of things, but namely it means that we are just woefully unprepared for what might come next, not by anyone’s fault, but out of necessity of this technology. So now we’re at a place where we need to spend time thinking about what might happen. My primary business is board and advisory, but I also do a lot of keynote speaking. I’m an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia where I help prepare undergrads for this new future. And I have a book coming out September 1st called Abundant, which is my vision for an AGI-powered future.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s incredible. So you’ve mentioned a couple of times AGI, artificial general intelligence. Can I ask, is that something that you think is close? That’s something that there’s been a lot of debate on, whether that’s happening in the next couple of years or whether we’re maybe further away. What’s your take on it?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close is a pretty qualified word. I don’t know that you need to actually split hairs here. In this case, it’s probably less than 20 years, and so whether it’s five years away or 10 years away, it doesn’t really matter. My prediction is that it’s probably five years away, maybe a little more, six or seven, but it’s in the scope of the next 10 to 15 years. As a result, we should be talking about it and preparing for it instead of splitting hairs on exactly when it arrives.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, absolutely. And that’s one of the things that we are seeing in the real estate and property management industry as well, is people want to understand what do they need to do to be ready. So that’s why we’re really excited to dig in with you today. Can you give us a quick point of view on the state of AI today, especially as it relates to real estate and property management businesses who may want to implement AI?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s separate those things. So the state of AI is that AI is getting a lot better all the time and a lot less expensive all the time. The next models will probably be many orders of magnitude better. So we’re seeing this super linear improvement in the performance of these models across basically every measure. Their ability to do math, their ability to work in multiple languages, their ability to work across modalities. Speech, text, vision. At the same time, the models are getting much less expensive. So this is true for a couple reasons. They’re compressing. We’re also getting better at how we actually run the models on the hardware itself. We’re figuring out how to build smaller models generally. And so as the models decline in price but improve in performance, what we observe is this economic phenomenon where a critical resource is becoming abundant (or much less expensive). And when that happens, historically there’s been this Cambrian explosion of economic opportunity and massive change.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So shifting now to how it will affect industries. Broadly, I don’t think that any industry will remain unchanged. Any industry though in particular that is subject to a lot of knowledge work. The easy heuristic here is: Does a human do a lot of work for this job or function on their laptop? That’s the easiest way to determine knowledge work because that usually defines how much text and computational power you’re requiring in your job. Those industries in particular will change quite a bit because AI is going to end up automating a lot of that computational work.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And that’s something that the property management industry is unique because a lot of that job does fall into what you just described, but there’s also aspects of it that don’t at all:  Getting units maintained, making sure that plumbing is working, helping people tour a new apartment. We’ve talked about this a lot with our customers, but the exciting thing about property management is that it’s a human-based business, and I think that what that means with AI is that it has the opportunity to reduce a lot of that busy work that keeps people away from the most core element of the job. So out of all the trends that are being reported right now, are there any that you think that the real estate industry should specifically be paying attention to right now?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most obvious trend that I would care about if I were in the real estate industry is the model’s ability to do better math. So that doesn’t mean anything right away, but it’s going to mean that a lot of the work that happens inside of the spreadsheets for property managers goes away. Now, to the point you just made, a lot of the work in property management broadly is spent actually managing the tenants. So there’s a ton that happens outside of the spreadsheets. The trend, therefore, we should observe is that most of the work of a property manager should actually return to managing and supporting the tenant in improving their lives and finding more tenants to occupy buildings, which is ultimately a general good service for the world because we need to reduce the housing shortage that we’re experiencing.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second trend, and I pointed this out earlier, but I have to stress this. This is not a fad for a lot of reasons, but it’s namely not a fad because the cost of this service continues to decline. This is becoming a ubiquitous service. And so you shouldn’t expect it to be anywhere except everywhere, right? The expectation here, the operating expectation for everyone should be that this will permeate all of their lives because the cost of serving it is declining so quickly.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and I’d imagine what that also means is that any businesses who wait around too long to get started on that and to implement that are going to be at a disadvantage because it’s going to be required to compete. Does that add up? Do you think that there’s a risk that if property management businesses wait too long to implement this technology, that they could be left behind?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average property manager, like the average knowledge worker, accountant, lawyer, etc., operates in a very competitive environment and optimizing margins becomes pretty critical. So if in five years, one property manager, one accountant, one lawyer isn’t actually using the tools at their service, the expectation is going to be that they are operating at a massive disadvantage.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And there are two ways to think about this. The first is, are you using these tools in a direct way? Meaning do you use Chat-GPT, do you use these other systems? And the other is, are you using them in an indirect way? Are they embedded into the technology that you use generally? And so what I think a lot of the major question that people are going to be asking themselves in the next year or two is, do my vendors, do my technology vendors have effective AI strategies? Are they actually going to be providing me the value of this technology in passive, indirect ways?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s a big question that everyone should be asking right now, because to the extent that your vendors, your technology vendors aren’t actually improving your performance using AI, you’re probably going to be at a massive disservice. </span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, there’s so many opportunities that we’re seeing for folks to use AI to increase their competitive edge. I want to dial back to something that you said around selecting a vendor who has a technology strategy, who has a vision for how AI will change the way that people interact with their tool. For those who aren’t experts on AI and who are really looking to the experts for advice, what are some questions that they should be asking or what are some ways that they can actually determine whether their vendors have that AI strategy that you mentioned?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, this one’s hard. I mean, everyone is going to say that they are delivering AI, and then the real question is: To what extent are they actually? And there’s going to be a lot of snake oil sold to a lot of people, and there already has been. There are two problems here. The first problem is that it’s actually going to become challenging to discern what’s real and what’s not because software is particularly demoable. The second problem is the market is going to move so quickly that it’s not actually going to be obvious if your vendor is at the bleeding edge or not.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the easiest heuristic here, in my opinion, is get good at using tools like ChatGPT, become self-sufficient on your own, such that you are not necessarily reliant on another system and you have a basis for comparison. The thing that I worry about is people who don’t have a basis for comparison will not actually be able to determine if their vendors are supercharging their products in the ways that they actually should be. And so the easiest way to become self-sufficient is to say, “I know that I can automate this step. I know that I can automate these forms. I know that I can automate this spreadsheet using AI. Why is my vendor not helping me with that?”</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that’s great advice. So we recently interviewed a few dozen property management professionals to see what their attitudes are about AI right now, and it was encouraging to see that a lot of them are viewing AI as a technology that’s going to change the way that we live and do business forever. So some of them talk about it in terms about how this is going to be a shift that’s similar to what we’ve seen with computers, the introduction of the internet, the introduction of smartphones. What are your thoughts on how AI is going to shape our future? Do you think that it’s possible to overstate it or do you think that, as I just described it, we’re underselling it?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My position is that AGI will be the last technology that humans invent on our own, and that hereafter we will enter a recursive learning loop wherein most technologies are discovered by AI, and we accelerate at a rate that we have never imagined before. The world in 50 years should look unrecognizable from the world today, let alone the world in 100 or 1000 years. I think there’s a very high probability that we cure cancer, that we cure neurodegenerative diseases, we solve quantum computing, nanotechnology, fusion energy, and my core thesis that we enter an era of abundance where we reduce the cost of most goods and services to zero. And then of course, there are a bunch of other costs, societal costs, upheaval that we need to negotiate and solve for. But no, unsurprisingly, you will find with me someone who believes that this is going to be a bigger moment than the internet or the computer.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, so you mentioned some of those potential costs or risks of this change, and so that was something that we saw in our conversations with real estate professionals as well. They’re grappling with fears of job displacement, ethical concerns for how this technology is implemented, and some potential for just machine-driven errors or issues with implementation. Do these fears align with what you’re seeing in general in other industries as well?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s fascinating about machines is that while they do have bias inherent in their systems, they’re actually very willing to explore that bias because they don’t have the same shame that we do.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so explainability is this really amazing, unique element of AI that humans do not possess. We are not explainable creatures. And even to the extent that we could be explainable, we never would explain our behavior perfectly. </span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethical concerns with AI are interesting to me in so far as they require explainability, but I remain convinced that systems that are at least driven by AI — now, I don’t think AI needs to make the final decision in a lot of cases, but are at least supported and driven by AI, the way we drive a plane and have pilots steer for the precision — should perform much better than systems that don’t. We should also observe that a lot of decisions do not need to be made by humans, and in fact shouldn’t be made by humans. And so the same property manager that’s concerned about an ethical outcome should actually go and explore, “Wait, what about all these other decisions that I’ve made personally? What has gone into those decisions?”</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And then on number one, job displacement is a really tricky one. What we observe in our two industrial revolutions that we’ve experienced as a species, is that there are more jobs on the other side of every industrial revolution and the jobs are better paying and safer. There’s a decline in global unemployment and on a per capita basis. And we also observe that the world actually improves on a net consumer power basis. So purchase power improves because the cost of goods and services decline. So the world is basically net better on almost every measure after the industrial revolutions.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is a cost to the industrial revolution that is not well understood yet, which is that in the United States, the most common last name is Smith. And the reason that it’s our most common last name is because we used to name ourselves after our occupations. And the reason we name ourselves after our occupations is that we in the post-industrial world, especially in a capitalist society, cannot disassociate our personal identities and our self-worth from our jobs. We have an inextricable link between what we do and how we feel about who we are.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so the real thing that we are facing, the real risk ahead of us is not a job displacement crisis, it’s an identity displacement crisis. It is the idea that our work will change so regularly and so much that we will not be able to attach our sense of self to what we do professionally. And this is going to cause incredible societal upheaval. This is going to be exceptionally tricky. And by the way, I don’t think it’s a net bad thing. I think it is a short-term price to pay. It’s a 50 or a 100-year price to pay for a much, much better future. But it is a generational price to pay. There is a generation of people that will have to update to this idea that we cannot simply say, “I am a lawyer, I’m an accountant, I am a property manager.” Right? That in fact, our work will change. And this is going to be tricky. This is going to be really tricky. And so the job displacement concern has this underlying economical consideration, and actually I’m worried about something far more emotional and societal.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So you mentioned these potential negative outcomes, but they’re far from certain, and it sounds like there are steps that can be taken now to avoid them or to minimize them. As it relates to real estate, what are maybe some of the things that we could do now or we could think about now as an industry to help avoid some of the possible negative outcomes?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professionally, the best advice I can give to any class of people is to consider what they are and what their purpose is outside of their jobs. So it is one thing to say, “I am a family member. I am a parent, I am a friend. I have these hobbies, I have these passions. These are my values.” It’s another thing to say, “I am this occupation.” And to the extent to which we are defining our purpose and our self-fulfillment on an occupation, I think we are exposing ourselves to a lot of risk. Our willingness and ability to say, “I’m much more than this job” will make it much easier for our work to change regularly. And this is the advice that I give broadly to industries.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically to property management, look, the extent to which property managers define their success as their tenants’ success, the yield rate, their occupancy rate and their tenants’ happiness, it becomes a much more humanistic endeavor. And so redefining the property management work around a people business and automating the rest of it seems like the most interesting way to actually create a more fulfilling world in which all the constituents — the property owner, the manager, and the renter — are happier.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. I love that vision. I think that’s something that a lot of the professionals we spoke to are hoping will happen. So shifting gears a little bit, the property management industry has a bad rap for being behind the times in terms of technology adoption. Where would you say that the vast majority of businesses or industries are on an AI maturity scale? Do you think that most businesses are where they need to be at this point?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one is where they need to be. Let’s be very clear. I don’t think anyone gets a gold star at this point. Again, for no one’s fault. Every industry, I will say every traditional industry wants to give it itself a bunch of discredit for being slow. Financial services says the same thing, insurance says the same thing, automobiles said the same. Everyone says, “Hey, we’re a laggard traditional industry.” I think there’s actually something to this, which is that everyone likes the idea that they are either a pioneer in a slow industry or that their industry is unique to the world. The truth is, my observation is everyone’s basically somewhere similar on this journey and this curve.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high likelihood is that we start to see these gold standards in every industry. That either a large property, a large traditional property manager adopts AI in a really fantastic way, or you start to see these pockets of small property managers build efficiencies that allow them to compete with the big ones on a cost basis, on a subcontractor basis, whatever, and that they start to set these standards by which everyone else can fast follow.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. That makes sense. I think that some of these really big picture benefits of AI, maybe a lot of businesses or decision-makers are not so much focused on those at this moment as they are on the short-term gains like, “If I were to implement X software, what is that going to mean for my team in the next year, in the next two years?” And so when we asked property management teams about the reasons right now that they’re considering implementing AI, it was all about reducing busy work. On a different survey last year, we saw that 15 hours a week, about 38% of an average 40-hour work week, property management teams felt like could be completely streamlined or optimized, done for them by technology. So this goal for the short-term, implementing AI to reduce busy work, do you think that that is one of the more common reasons across industries that people are looking at implementing AI?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m just going to reframe it, which is busy work is the crux of computational work. We have a term for computationally-intensive work, which we call busy work. People define busy work different places on the same spectrum because some of us enjoy computationally-intensive work more than others. So to one accountant, busy work is actually work. Where to someone else, busy work is all terrible. I’d make the argument that 70% of someone’s day can be streamlined, like truly. Having observed a lot of industries and a lot of people behaving, it is not obvious to me that most of the computational work that we do at our laptops cannot be automated. And therefore, the question we need to start asking is, what is the work that requires humanistic skills and qualities? What is the truly uniquely humanistic work that AI cannot do? And I don’t think this is like a 5-year… I’m not talking about a five, 5-year journey. I’m talking about in the next year or two.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI is going to be exceptionally good at math, it’s going to be exceptionally good at speaking, listening, writing, and it will have an observational understanding or a encyclopedic understanding of the physical world. We’re going to start automating a ton of stuff, and one man’s busy work is another man’s joy, but in the end, if it’s computationally-intensive and repetitive, it’s going to get automated. I don’t think that anyone is fully appreciating yet how quickly these models are going to improve in performance. That being said, yeah, this seems like a very good place to actually build a heuristic and just say, “Hey, if I want to improve my underlying business, here’s the 20% of my team’s day that is spent doing the same thing.” Filling out the same form, sending the same email, et cetera. That seems like a great place to start.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you’re intellectually honest, you’ll expand that aperture quite a bit once you realize that a lot of your team’s day is actually spent doing things that don’t actually challenge their mind very much. And the hard part is actually spent calling a tenant and having a tough conversation about a rent check or going to a property and exploring some really complex broken thing or trying to figure out exactly how to price a new property. These are places where we actually want to be spending a bunch of our time and end up getting sort of tossed away with everything else. “Oh, I’ll call this tenant late tonight because I have a bunch of other things to do,” And you put off this extremely important sort of pivotal moment in someone’s life and really critical moment in your day because everything else is filling up. And in fact, maybe these are the moments that we should be spending most of our time on and let machines do everything else.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely. I want to chat a little bit about AI implementation. So at this point, I think we’re on board with the benefits that AI can offer us, but successfully implementing that technology is where I think some are feeling overwhelmed. So based on your experience, what are some of the must-have or foundational prerequisites that businesses need to have in place to actually be successful when they implement AI technology?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it’s just cultural. I really do. The hard part here is just going to be: Do you have a class of people in your organization that are inclined to new things? And so the culture of adaptability and learning becomes the critical resource in the future. And quite honestly, we’re going to see… I think a lot of property managers are going to be very surprised by the ease with which their firm adopts this technology if they have the interest. I get to see this with my mom, for example. ChatGPT is pretty obvious to her how to use, which is impressive for someone who generally doesn’t use a lot of technology. It’s just a learner’s mindset that’s required here.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. That learner’s mindset I think is going to be key. So do you have any tips around training?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is, again, most of these tools are pretty obvious how to use. The beauty of AI is that it moves a world from a deeply Web 1 or Web 2.0 world with lots of forms and fields and rules to actually a natural language world. Inspiring a learner’s mindset probably seems like the most important factor.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. And as you mentioned, the technology itself is going to help train us. One of the things that we’re thinking about with the conversational user interface is that a new employee could come in on day one and ask it, “How do I see the rent roll for my properties? Or how do I get to the page where I manage this function of the lease?” And the AI tool could tell them, “Click here or do it this way.” And that training burden where they would’ve had to go tap their manager on the shoulder, take 20 minutes out of their day is now baked into the system.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it clearly has a lot of different potential benefits for teams. But what about customers? So let’s talk a little bit about the customer experience. And in our context, that typically means renters. Sometimes it can mean owners or investors as well. So how can adopting AI solutions actually help the business’s external customers as well as their internal team?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think about most of AI benefits from a customer standpoint, to be honest. Most of my economic viewpoints come from this idea that the faster that industries adopt AI, the faster the customers will see massive benefits. So if every property manager in the world improves their adoption of AI, then it should lower the cost of serving property management services and it should lower the economic burden for everyone. And maybe this is naive. I have this suspicion that actually industries will become so much more economically efficient that the value will distribute pretty evenly, that all the constituents will start to benefit massively from this massive deflationary event. Because today basically doing things is really expensive, at least on a relative basis. Tomorrow, relatively things should be much less expensive, all things. And if all things are much less expensive, lots of good things will come from that.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing is if someone can adopt AI to improve the speed with which renters receive service calls, information about their apartments, lease application feedback, all these things that historically can feel like this arduous task. By the way, not really for anyone’s fault. Again, it’s just a complex system. Everyone wins. And building a better lives for tenants, I have to imagine is something that a lot of property managers want.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah. So I think we’re imagining this fear where we’re going to get negative feedback from renters about having to interact with AI, but we’re overlooking possibly the fact that they will simply appreciate getting their questions answered faster or getting their sink fixed faster, whatever it may be, whether that interaction was mediated by AI or not. The most important thing is that resolution time.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, it’s been a while, but when I rented … If I had a problem, like my dishwasher broke, I didn’t need to talk to a human, I needed my dishwasher fixed. I have this acute problem that should require little human intervention, and I want to know when it’s going to get fixed as soon as possible. I want to know that it’s logged in a system, first of all, and then I want to know when it’s going to get fixed. And I think for most renters, that’s got to be true.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh yeah, that adds up with what we’ve seen because we also survey renters to find out what they care about. Maintenance issues are top of the list, like the biggest driver of satisfaction — and speed to resolution is huge, and that impacts retention and the amount of work that property management teams need to do with keeping occupancy high. So yes, it’s a huge one. So there’s lots of ways that AI can be used to improve the customer experience. Are there any exceptions? Are there any services or maybe times where you would say AI should not be used in customer interactions?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it depends. But look, if you’re going to raise someone’s rent, you should probably make that phone call. And you’d probably make that visit, in fact. Housing is a societal necessity. And we need to build a lot more of it, and we need to make it a lot easier to get access to it. And to the extent that property managers are forced to make really hard conversations, these are the sort of things that should be done human to human. And frankly, these are probably the things that property managers struggle with the most.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you create a bunch of time in the day to have these hard conversations, “Hey, you’re late on your rent again. Hey, we need to raise your rent. Hey, the property’s actually going to be sold.” Managing these conversations well change lives. Truly change lives. If you can look someone in the eyes and say, “This is why this decision is being made,” it can at least help someone make sense of a very complex situation. Receiving a letter in the mail to say, “Hey, you have 30 days to find a new home.” That’s the kind of behavior that we need to put an end to. These are hard conversations that should be had in person. And if we free up a bunch of time on the property management side to do the busy work, then I think it is incumbent on property management to do the hard part well. And the hard part is the humanistic stuff. It’s the stuff that we don’t really want to assign AI to do. I think that’s great. I think it builds a much better world.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, and as you mentioned, housing is a necessity. So that’s something that we’re especially seeing in the world of affordable housing management. And you mentioned this when you talked about areas with high regulatory burdens, affordable housing definitely falls in that category. Sometimes properties will be participating in multiple different programs to make those units affordable. And keeping track of those requirements is one of the most onerous things possible. And so I think that what you’re talking about with technology and AI’s ability to do a lot of those tasks and to keep track of all of the details and to calculate so much of the work that gets done in the backend to free people up to have those conversations, that’s important in conventional housing, but how much more important is that in the world of affordable housing, helping somebody figure out what do they need to do to keep their housing or to find a more appropriate unit? I think that’s a huge opportunity for property management teams to make a positive impact.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, I agree.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so I guess I’ll ask this: What do you think companies should be doing right now to help future-proof their business in this new AI landscape?</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zack Kass:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, I think outside of adopting AI, companies need to start hiring and training for humanistic skills and qualities. Businesses that are dependent on or rely on this idea of specialization I think are going to struggle tremendously in the future because the idea that you are the most knowledgeable company, or the most skilled company, is actually a very moving target and going to be eventually probably commoditized. The idea that you are the most thoughtful, empathetic, courageous, curious company suddenly becomes much more valuable because… Why? Because these are things that AI cannot do. The idea that you are hiring for and training for and incentivizing for behaviors that AI does not possess, adaptability, curiosity, et cetera, I think is the best way to future-proof a business of people.</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Megan Eales Monroe:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the future of AI is being written in real-time — and continues to evolve by the minute — it’s clear from our conversations with Zack today that the best way to future-proof your business, and prepare for the upcoming AI-driven landscape, is to start right now. This includes:</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinforcing a “learning mindset” within your company culture</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using AI to help teams focus more on “human” tasks and less on busywork</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting comfortable with generative AI platforms and tools in general</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And asking your technology partners and vendors to share their AI strategy and roadmap to ensure they’re helping you stay one step ahead of the next technological revolution</span>\n",
      "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d like to thank Zack Kass for joining us on this episode and helping to demystify the future of AI. We look forward to continuing the conversations around all things real estate, artificial intelligence, and beyond in future episodes of The Top Floor.</span>\n",
