      "After a decade of relative stability in mortgage rates, the last few years have seen unprecedented volatility and changes in mortgage rates. Interest rates are often a key concern for real estate investors, as mortgages are often the difference between a cash-flowing deal and a dud.  \n",
      "Since spring 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest rate-hiking cycle, interest rates on the most popular loans for real estate investors, DSCR loans (part of the non-QM loans category), have moved at unprecedented rates. Many months of rates moving at most a few basis points a week morphed into dramatic, massive movements—with bigger changes sometimes happening in one day than had occurred in quarters or years prior.\n",
      "Real estate investors navigating the challenging market of 2024—with mortgage rates still at elevated levels—are at an advantage when they can lock in financing terms or plan purchases while DSCR loan rates are favorable. But figuring out what to look for and what moves mortgage markets can be challenging.  \n",
      "We’ll help pull back the curtain a bit on the biggest drivers of mortgage rates, as well as how investors can watch the market like a financial expert does.\n",
      "Bond Market Concepts: What Determines Mortgage Rates?\n",
      "In the United States in 2024, mortgage rates are generally tied to the overall bond market, as most residential mortgages, including conventional qualifying mortgages for owner-occupants, residential investment mortgages (DSCR loans), and even other alternative residential mortgages (non-QM), are securitized. This means they are bundled together and turned into bonds, financial instruments that pay out interest (yield) to investors looking for a steady, fixed return. These investors are typically large financial institutions looking for safe, predictable returns, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks.\n",
      "Key concepts to understand in economics and finance are risk and reward. Risk should be thought of neither as good nor bad, but rather always in relation to the associated reward or returns. \n",
      "For example, a 10% return (or reward) can be worth the risk if you are investing in a Class A single-family rental in a great market with an A+ tenant, but not worth the risk at all if betting on a 16-seed to make it to the Final Four in March Madness.\n",
      "Investors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.  \n",
      "When people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\n",
      "However, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.  \n",
      "One key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond. \n",
      "These mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\n",
      "Without delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.  \n",
      "This means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.  \n",
      "For DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\n",

      "Note on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\n",
      "Before diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.  \n",
      "Typically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else. \n",
      "This is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\n",
      "Key Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\n",
      "Here are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\n",
      "Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n",
      "For even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\n",
      "CPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\n",
      "Remember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.  You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.  \n",
      "If you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\n",
      "Jobs report\n",
      "Another key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\n",
      "In 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\n",
      "These reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\n",
      "Jobless claims\n",
      "While the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\n",
      "Producer Price Index (PPI)\n",
      "The Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\n",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\n",
      "The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report. \n",
      "While the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\n",
      "Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\n",
      "The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S. \n",
      "Like other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to. \n",
      "One recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade. \n",
      "The fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\n",
      "Fed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\n",
      "While Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\n",
      "However, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\n",
      "Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\n",
      "An additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\n",
      "University of Michigan Survey\n",
      "As inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\n",
      "Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\n",
      "Another factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen. \n",
      "One example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\n",
      "Auctions\n",
      "Large Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing. \n",
      "Unlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "While the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.  \n",
      "When will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\n",

      "Investors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.  \n",
      "When people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\n",
      "However, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.  \n",
      "One key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond. \n",
      "These mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\n",
      "Without delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.  \n",
      "This means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.  \n",
      "For DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\n",

      "Note on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\n",
      "Before diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.  \n",
      "Typically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else. \n",
      "This is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\n",
      "Key Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\n",
      "Here are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\n",
      "Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n",
      "For even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\n",
      "CPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\n",
      "Remember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.  You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.  \n",
      "If you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\n",
      "Jobs report\n",
      "Another key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\n",
      "In 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\n",
      "These reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\n",
      "Jobless claims\n",
      "While the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\n",
      "Producer Price Index (PPI)\n",
      "The Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\n",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\n",
      "The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report. \n",
      "While the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\n",
      "Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\n",
      "The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S. \n",
      "Like other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to. \n",
      "One recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade. \n",
      "The fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\n",
      "Fed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\n",
      "While Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\n",
      "However, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\n",
      "Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\n",
      "An additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\n",
      "University of Michigan Survey\n",
      "As inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\n",
      "Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)\n",
      "Another factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen. \n",
      "One example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\n",
      "Auctions\n",
      "Large Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing. \n",
      "Unlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "While the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.  \n",
      "When will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\n",

      "We took the current value of all homes (as of April 2019) in the largest 50 metro areas and calculated the share affordable in each ZIP code to a would-be buyer that earns the local median income. Homes were considered affordable if 30% or less of the metro’s median monthly income was required to afford a mortgage payment and other expenses, including property taxes, on that home.\n",
      "In order to find the share of affordable homes on the market, we calculated the maximum amount that the median income could allocate towards a mortgage payment. We evaluated the value of each home, subtracted a 20% down payment and calculated the monthly mortgage payment using the prevailing 30-year fixed mortgage rate (according to Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey). We also factored in mortgage insurance and property taxes. Based on these calculations, we determined the share of homes that were affordable without exceeding 30% of the median monthly income for that metro. Median household income is based on the U.S. Census’ 2017 1-Year American Community Survey.\n",

      "{'title': 'What Are Current DSCR Loan Rates? Key Market Movers and How to Track Rates', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by\\xa0Easy Street Capital. Read our\\xa0editorial guidelines\\xa0for more information.\\nAfter a decade of relative stability in mortgage rates, the last few years have seen unprecedented volatility and changes in mortgage rates. Interest rates are often a key concern for real estate investors, as mortgages are often the difference between a cash-flowing deal and a dud.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince spring 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest rate-hiking cycle, interest rates on the most popular loans for real estate investors, DSCR loans (part of the non-QM loans category), have moved at unprecedented rates. Many months of rates moving at most a few basis points a week morphed into dramatic, massive movements—with bigger changes sometimes happening in one day than had occurred in quarters or years prior.\\nReal estate investors navigating the challenging market of 2024—with mortgage rates still at elevated levels—are at an advantage when they can lock in financing terms or plan purchases while DSCR loan rates are favorable. But figuring out what to look for and what moves mortgage markets can be challenging.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe’ll help pull back the curtain a bit on the biggest drivers of mortgage rates, as well as how investors can watch the market like a financial expert does.\\nBond Market Concepts: What Determines Mortgage Rates?\\nIn the United States in 2024, mortgage rates are generally tied to the overall bond market, as most residential mortgages, including conventional qualifying mortgages for owner-occupants, residential investment mortgages (DSCR loans), and even other alternative residential mortgages (non-QM), are securitized. This means they are bundled together and turned into bonds, financial instruments that pay out interest (yield) to investors looking for a steady, fixed return. These investors are typically large financial institutions looking for safe, predictable returns, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks.\\nKey concepts to understand in economics and finance are risk and reward. Risk should be thought of neither as good nor bad, but rather always in relation to the associated reward or returns.\\xa0\\nFor example, a 10% return (or reward) can be worth the risk if you are investing in a Class A single-family rental in a great market with an A+ tenant, but not worth the risk at all if betting on a 16-seed to make it to the Final Four in March Madness.\\nInvestors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen people refer to the Federal Reserve “setting rates,” they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\\nHowever, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the “risk-free” rate—and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond.\\xa0\\nThese mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\\nWithout delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors’ guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\\nBefore diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTypically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else.\\xa0\\nThis is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus “priced in” ahead of time.\\nKey Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\\nHere are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\\nFor even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\\nCPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The “headline” number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an “all items index” rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\\nRemember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.\\xa0\\xa0You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called “print”). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that’s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn’t seem to move things, this is probably why.\\nJobs report\\nAnother key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\\nIn 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\\nThese reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\\nJobless claims\\nWhile the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\\nProducer Price Index (PPI)\\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report.\\xa0\\nWhile the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. It’s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S.\\xa0\\nLike other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to.\\xa0\\nOne recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey—reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade.\\xa0\\nThe fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable—and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\\nFed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\\nWhile Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\\nHowever, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions—the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\\nAdditionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute’s release makes much of the data stale, the minute’s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\\nAn additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a “dot plot” showing each Fed official’s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\\nUniversity of Michigan Survey\\nAs inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\\nPurchasing Managers Index (PMI)\\nAnother factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen.\\xa0\\nOne example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it’s critical to understand how the metric is derived—in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\\nAuctions\\nLarge Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing.\\xa0\\nUnlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nWhile the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions—which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\\nFollow the author of this article, Easy Street Capital Partner Robin Simon, on multiple social platforms, including X and BiggerPockets, for daily market insights as well!\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by Easy Street Capital\\n\\nEasy Street Capital is a private real estate lender headquartered in Austin, Texas, serving real estate investors around the country.

      "{'title': 'How to Collect Rent from Tenants: The Landlord’s Ultimate Guide to Rent Collection', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nOnline rent collection is more efficient than traditional methods.Clear communication with tenants is key for on-time payments.Strategies like screening, incentives, and apps help ensure timely rent. \\n\\nCollecting rent on time from tenants is the biggest pain point for most landlords. Late rent payments disrupt your cash flow and cause unnecessary stress. You may also struggle to cover mortgage payments and pay bills when rent doesn’t come in on time.\\xa0\\nThe solution? Know how to collect rent from tenants on time every month. This ensures healthy cash flow and boosts your bottom line.\\nRent collection should never be a game of “catch me if you can.” After all, chasing tenants for late rent is never as much fun as chasing after Fido, who’s run off with your prized possession. Tenants need proper training to deliver rent on time. And training starts with implementing the correct methods and tools to collect rent every month.\\nWhat are the best ways to optimize the rent collection process and avoid late or missed payments? We’ll examine the best methods to collect rent and discuss traditional ways of collecting rent versus online rent payments. In the end, you can decide on the best solution for you and your tenants.\\nTenant Rent Collection Methods: Traditional vs. Online\\nYour chosen payment method significantly impacts efficient rent collection. Many landlords still rely on paper checks, whereas there is a growing shift toward using online platforms or ACH bank transfers. Let’s compare these methods to find out how to collect rent from tenants on time.\\nTraditional methods\\nTraditional methods for collecting rent are cash or a paper check. What are the pros and cons of these methods?\\n\\nPhysical checks: The most common method is for tenants to mail rent checks. This is convenient for them, and the check is delivered to you. However, this process can become time-consuming if you have several rental properties. For example, you must drive to the bank, deposit the money, and wait for the checks to clear. Then you deal with bounced checks and the old excuse of “The check is in the mail, it must be lost.”\\nIn-person rent collection: Collecting cash in person is not an acceptable payment method. There are several reasons why. First, you should never collect cash payments because it’s unsafe. Second, you put yourself in the “chasing rent” category. Third, it’s ineffective and wastes your precious time.\\nTenants drop rent off at your home: Collecting rent in person at home is another big no-no. Giving out your home address to tenants is never a good idea. Do you really want an angry tenant showing up on your doorstep because you sent a late rent notice? Remember, you’re running a rental property business, not a hobby. So, try to keep your business and personal life as separate as possible.\\n\\nIn summary, while traditional rent collection methods like physical checks may be convenient, they also have several drawbacks. They are inefficient for timely rent collection, especially when modern methods exist.\\nOnline rent collection\\nSeveral online payment solutions can help ensure consistent rent collection. These methods range from online banking transfers to money transfer apps and dedicated rent collection platforms.\\nLet’s look at the best online rent collection systems to streamline your rental business and ensure a steady income from your properties.\\n\\nACH payments: This system simplifies the rent collection process. You no longer must process physical checks or cash. Also, automatic payments reduce the administrative burden for you and your tenants. However, it’s a good idea to check out bank fees for setting up and accepting ACH transfers.\\nDirect deposit: Getting tenants to set up direct deposit can help ensure regular rental income. A direct deposit is a form of ACH transfer where the money arrives directly in your bank account. While direct deposits are free for the sender (tenant), you may have to pay transaction fees to receive the money.\\nOnline rent payment platforms: One of the best ways to collect rent is to use a rent payment app. In many cases, these rent collection platforms do more than facilitate rental payments. They often include late payment fee collection, handling maintenance requests, managing security deposits, and reporting rent payment history to credit bureaus.\\nPayNearMe: Tenants who don’t have a bank account can use PayNearMe to pay monthly rent in cash. They use their unique card to pay at a local ACE Cash Express, 7-Eleven, or similar vendor. The tenant receives proof of payment, and you get instant notification of money in your bank account. This method to collect rent is free for landlords and costs tenants a small fee.\\nCash apps: Money transfer apps like PayPal, Wise, Venmo, Apple Pay, or Zelle are convenient ways to send and receive money. But are they a way to collect rent from tenants? These peer-to-peer payment services are not the best options for rental property owners. For example, you cannot block partial payments during an eviction process. Also, transaction fees can be costly if you have many rental properties.\\n\\nOnline rent collection is convenient and efficient, making it popular among landlords. However, not every option will work for you, depending on your business and tenants. Therefore, you must decide which is the most suitable to ensure efficient rent collection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich Rent Collection Method to Choose?\\nKnowing how to collect rent efficiently requires balancing convenience and efficiency for you and your tenants. Tenants may prefer sending rent by mail because it’s easier for them. On the other hand, online payment collection methods are quick, convenient, and secure.\\nHere’s a comparison of the various rent collection methods.\\nMethodCost*\\xa0SecureConvenience*Recurring payments?Automaticlate fees?Instant notifications?Block partialpayments?Report tocredit bureaus?Propertymanagement?Paper checksFreeModerateModerateNoNoNoYesNoNoIn-person collectionTravel to propertiesLowLowNoNoNoYesNoNoACH payments/direct depositLow feesYesHighYesNoYesYesNoNoRent payment appsLow feesYesHighYesYesYesYesYesYesCash appsLow feesYesModerateNoNoYesNoNoNoPayNearMeNoneHighHighNoNoYesNoNoNo\\n* The cost and convenience are from the landlord’s perspective.\\xa0You might also likeLandlording & Property ManagementWhat to Do When a Tenant Violates the Lease: A Landlord’s GuideLandlording & Property ManagementThe Ultimate Move-In Checklist for LandlordsLandlording & Property ManagementA Landlord’s Guide to Legally Breaking a LeaseLandlording & Property ManagementHow to Market Your Rental Property (8 Tips for Landlords)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Concerns About Collecting Rent From Tenants\\nSwitching to online rent collection methods can raise concerns for landlords. For example, you may worry about security, handling late payments, and compliance with local and state rental laws. Additionally, you may need to convince tenants to switch to an online rent payment service.\\nLet’s address common concerns about how to collect rent from tenants using modern methods.\\nSecurity and privacy\\nEnsuring the privacy and security of tenants’ personal and financial information is vital. As a landlord, you must adopt securely encrypted payment methods and adhere to data protection regulations to prevent fraud and identity theft.\\nThe good news is that online payment platforms offer robust security measures. These platforms use encryption technology to protect sensitive information like bank account numbers and credit card details. They also adhere to industry regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).\\nGetting tenants on board\\nOne of the biggest challenges is convincing tenants to switch to an online rent payment system. Tenants may be hesitant to start using a system they’re unfamiliar with. Also, as of 2022, reports indicate that 58% of the 24 million offline households don’t see the need to be online, and 18% of these say they cannot afford a home internet service.\\nClear communication about the benefits of paying rent online is critical to make the transition. Explain its convenience, like recurring payments, proof of payment, and rent payment history, as well as no more paper checks getting lost in the mail or ending up in the wrong hands.\\nIntegration with accounting systems\\nRent collection software often features seamless integration with accounting systems. Think of how much time you save on lodging paper checks. Not only does this cut down on administrative work, but it also minimizes the risk of errors.\\nHandling late payments\\nAny landlord knows that late payments disrupt cash flow and add stress. What can you do if your tenant misses a rent payment?\\nEffective communication is crucial in resolving disputes. Therefore, try to understand why the rent is late. However, you must also understand local landlord-tenant laws and check the lease agreement to take appropriate action.\\nIn most cases, you should charge late rent fees. Of course, this may sound callous if the tenant is facing a temporary hardship. But it will help to ensure on-time rent payments in the future.\\nHere are a few tips on resolving issues with late payment of rent:\\n\\nHave a clear late fee policy in the rental agreement.\\nEncourage the tenant to borrow money or use a credit card to pay rent.\\nOffer a partial payment agreement if appropriate.\\n\\nPayment verification\\nOnline payments resolve the problems of payment tracking and verification. We all know that processing paper checks is time-consuming and cumbersome. Also, the tenant doesn’t know when or if you receive their check in the mail. This process can lead to misunderstandings and late rent notices.\\nOnline rent payment systems benefit both the tenant and landlord, as both parties can quickly and easily view payment records, ensuring the rent is paid on time.\\nFees and costs\\nManaging the costs associated with different payment methods can be a concern. Tenants may refuse to use a payment system that incurs extra transaction fees. Additionally, some online payment portals make it free to send money, but charge fees on receipt.\\nTherefore, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various payment options is wise to ensure they don’t impact your rental income.\\nCompliance with laws\\nNavigating local, state, and federal laws can be a nightmare for anyone running a rental business. So it’s vital to keep up to date on regulations regarding rent collection, late fees, and eviction processes. Also, going online means complying with data protection laws and ensuring your systems are secure.\\nSuccessful landlords realize the importance of hiring a lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law. Additionally, digital payments and electronic file storage are safer than traditional methods if you have the proper security measures.\\nTips for Encouraging On-Time Rent Payments\\nRegular rental income is your bread and butter, so ensuring you collect rent from all tenants every month is crucial to your bottom line. What are the best ways to ensure timely rent payments and maintain a successful rental business?\\nLet’s examine a few ways to keep your rental cash flow healthy.\\nClear communication\\nFirst, you must have a clear, unambiguous rent collection policy in the lease agreement. Terms of the lease agreement regarding rent payments should include:\\n\\nThe monthly rent amount\\nRent due day\\nApproved payment methods\\nGrace period for late rent payments (check local rental laws)\\nLate fee policy\\nRent increases\\n\\nBefore you draft the lease agreement, have a real estate attorney check it for compliance with local, state, and federal laws.\\nTenant screening\\nTenant screening is critical to ensuring on-time rent payments. Remember, letting a tenant into your rental property is easy, but it’s much harder to get them out, even if they stop paying rent. Therefore, due diligence is crucial when screening tenants.\\nEssential points in the screening process include:\\n\\nEmployment history\\nRental background check, including previous evictions\\nCredit history\\nIncome at least three times the rent price\\n\\nSend reminders to tenants\\nLet’s face it: We’re all busy—including your tenants. So, a gentle reminder that rent day is approaching can help minimize late payments. You can set up automated emails or SMS messages or use the function in a rent payment app.\\nOffer incentives for on-time rent payments\\nEncourage tenants to make on-time payments by offering incentives. Here are a few ideas:\\n\\nOffer tenants a discount for punctual rent payments for a certain number of months.\\nKnock $20 off the rental price when they pay before the due date.\\nSet aside $5 each month when they pay rent on time, and reward them with a gift card when they renew their lease.\\n\\nSet up automatic rent payments\\nEncourage tenants to set up recurring monthly payments through their bank or a rent collection platform. Automatic payments ensure you can collect rent every month without reminding the tenant.\\nCredit reporting to encourage tenants to pay rent on time\\nOffering to report on-time rent payments to credit bureaus is an excellent way to encourage on-time payments. This incentive benefits tenants who want to build their credit history. It can also incentivize them to switch to an online rent payment app.\\nEnforce late fees\\nCharging late fees per the rental agreement is always a good idea. Although it may be tempting to waive the fees, you risk allowing bad habits to develop. Also, if you waive the fees for one tenant, you may have to waive them for all the tenants in a multifamily property.\\nOf course, individual tenants may have extenuating circumstances. If they are excellent tenants who always pay on time, you may decide to cancel the late fee.\\nOffer flexible payment options\\nThe traditional method of collecting rent on the first of the month may not work for all tenants. Many self-employed people work in the gig economy and don’t receive wages on a specific day. So, offering to split rent payments into two or three installments a month may help you collect rent regularly with no late payments.\\nOffer multiple payment options\\nStatistics show that consumers are shifting to faster electronic payment methods. Therefore, offering options to pay rent by credit or debit card can boost on-time rent payments. This option can allow tenants to reap the benefits of credit card payments such as cash back, reward points, and bonuses.\\nPartial rent payments\\nUnfortunately, some good tenants get into temporary financial difficulty. Rather than serve an eviction notice, you could work out a mutually agreeable payment plan. This option could allow tenants to get back on their feet while you avoid a costly eviction process.\\nOffering partial rent payments isn’t suitable for every tenant, but it can help you keep good tenants experiencing short-term cash flow issues. As always, put everything in writing to communicate the terms for paying rent over an extended period.\\nUse a rent collection app\\nProperty management software can streamline the rent collection process. Chances are that most of your tenants already use smartphones. A rent payment app has features like automatic payments, instant notifications, and easy payment tracking, making collecting rent from tenants on time easier.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLearning the art of rent collection is crucial for running a successful rental business. Implementing efficient, effective rent collection strategies can minimize stress, improve cash flow, and help maintain a positive relationship with your tenants.\\nSwitching to online payment systems helps streamline the rent payment and collection process. To simplify the process, use clear communication, incentives, rent reminder emails, and recurring rent payments. This way, you can effectively collect rent from tenants on time every month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSave time and money with this refreshing guide to managing your own properties.\\nIn The Self-Managing Landlord, Amelia McGee and Grace Gudenkauf share the secrets of efficient property management, tenant screening and onboarding, and scaling your business—all to help you break free from the 9-to-5 grind and create lasting wealth through real estate.\\n\\nGet Your Copy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote By BiggerPockets: These are opinions written by the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of BiggerPockets.\\n\\n'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Texas Has Some of the Fastest-Growing Cities in the United States—Should You Invest Before It’s Too Late?', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nAccording to the latest U.S. Census data, between July 2022 and July 2023, eight of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the United States were located in Texas.Texan cities routinely top the charts on its ability to cash flow. McAllen, Odessa, Corpus Christi, and El Paso made BiggerPockets' Top 10 Cash Flow Markets in 2024.But, rising property taxes, insurance, and overheated markets might give an investor pause when investing in Texas. \\n\\nEverything is bigger in Texas—including the growth of some of its most under-the-radar cities. According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures, between July 2022 and July 2023, eight of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the nation were in Texas.\\nThe unassuming Dallas suburb of Celina saw meteoric growth of 26.6%, more than 53 times the nation’s average growth rate of 0.5%. Following Celina were several smaller, less well-known Texas towns:\\xa0\\n\\nFulshear: 25.6% increase\\nPrinceton: 22.3% increase\\nAnna: 16.9% increase\\nGeorgetown: 10.6% increase\\nProsper: 10.5% increase\\nForney: 10.4% increase\\nKyle: 9% increase\\xa0\\n\\nLarger Texas towns fared well, too. Houston is currently the fourth-largest U.S. city, gaining on third-place Chicago.\\nWhy Texas?\\nFavorable taxes, jobs, lower-priced housing, a warm climate, and high-quality living have all driven the population surge from colder, high-priced Northern cities. However, the dramatic population increase in smaller towns might be more straightforward than that.\\xa0\\n“The list of fastest-growing cities includes a lot of smaller cities that are not likely to be on many people’s radar,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, in a press release. “Smaller areas often top these lists because their smaller size makes it easier for them to see large percent changes.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Affordable Are the Top Small Towns in Texas?\\nAccording to Realtor.com data, affordability isn’t always at the top of the list when choosing a place to live. Celina’s median home price of $679,999 is way above the national average. Rather, it’s coveted for its good schools and low crime rate. The hour-long commute to Dallas is also a plus.\\xa0\\nSimilarly, Fulshear, also high on the list, has a median home price of $519,000 and is only an hour away from Houston.\\nTexas Cash Flows, Too\\nWhile some of the fastest-growing cities in Texas comprised pricey single-family homes, less expensive housing in the state also dominates the country’s cash flow markets, too. Texas occupied six of the 10 most cash-flowing markets in the U.S., according to BiggerPockets data.\\nWhy Southern Texas is a Great Place to Invest\\nMcAllen, Texas, has been an investor favorite for years. According to BiggerPockets data, the city has a rent-to-price ratio of 0.84%, a median “owner-occupied” sales price of under $100,000, and a median rent price of around $800. Low-cost housing and rents mean that many investors can scale quickly.\\xa0\\nAlthough Realtor.com data tells a slightly different story, with the median home price sold being $285,300, this is likely due to the vast spread of house prices between lower and higher in the city, which offers multiple types of employment, from consulting services, financial services, medical, and education. Homes valued at around $150,000 in 2023 experienced an 80% increase in market value over the preceding five years. Other areas saw prices increase by over 100% in the same period as residents from California and elsewhere relocated during the pandemic amid the remote working boom.\\nBiggerPockets data reveals that the other southern Texas cities of Odessa, Corpus Christi, and El Paso also dominate the highest cash flow cities in the country due to affordability. The border towns and Gulf areas offer multiple types of employment, from military bases to medical, e-commerce fulfillment centers, food processing, and energy. In an age of high interest rates, these affordable Texan towns with robust employment make them great places to invest, either as an all-cash buyer or with a larger down payment, to refinance once rates fall.\\nBeware of Rising Property Taxes\\nThough many parts of Texas offer affordable housing, pricier cities that have appreciated significantly in recent years have seen property taxes soar, making them some of the most expensive in the country.\\xa0\\nAccording to a recent analysis by Axios, median property taxes on Texas single-family homes grew by 26% between 2019 and 2023 without accounting for inflation. Lawmakers have been trying to stem the increases and have had some success. Many property owners across the state saw their taxes fall by 28% in 2023.\\n“The bottom line is that it’s a much more taxpayer-friendly environment, particularly for homeowners, than it was before 2019, and even more so after last year’s increase in the homestead exemption,” Lynn Krebs, a research economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University, told Texastribune.org. Before the cuts, some residents saw their tax bill increase by as much as 31% between 2018 and 2023.You might also likeHousing MarketsThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate—and Lessons From ItHousing MarketsMalta is a Hot, Stunning Island Market in Europe—Here’s How to Invest ThereHousing MarketsFlorida Is the Perfect Rent-to-Own Market—Should You Take Advantage?Housing MarketsThese U.S. Cities Are Overflowing with Affordable Single-Family Homes Under $300k\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe issue of property taxes is contentious. Dispensing with taxes that would otherwise have been used for school district maintenance is a tough sell beyond what has already been achieved. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told the Texas Public Policy Foundation last year that the state would need approximately $55 billion to offset the cost of school district maintenance for 2024-2025, amounting to almost two-fifths of the state’s $144.1 billion general fund budget.\\nShould taxes continue to increase without the relief of lower interest rates, investors would need to look closely at their bottom-line cash flow numbers and choose to invest with large down payments or as all-cash buyers. Those who invested over a decade ago have enjoyed some golden years in appreciation and cash flow.\\xa0\\nHowever, that doesn’t mean another halcyon era of Texas investing doesn’t lie ahead. With businesses relocating and cities attracting new residents, Texas remains a great place to deploy your cash. However, unless you’re ready to put down a large amount of money, look at least for appreciation rather than cash flow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'From a Panic Attack To My First Deal in Just 90 Days: How I Mastered Real Estate Deal Finding', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nI started learning about real estate investing after experiencing an early morning panic attack about my financial situation.My first deal came through word of mouth, and I secured financing by borrowing against my wife's 401(k).I learned from other successful investors and wholesalers about generating leads and finding deals, and you can easily do the same. \\n\\nThis is the story of my journey to finding real estate deals—or rather, my journey to learning how crucial real estate deal finding is to solving the puzzle of becoming a successful real estate investor. The best way I know how to tell this is through a story, which starts with my first real estate deal.\\nAn Early-Morning Anxiety Attack\\nMany people might not know this, but I did my first real estate deal 90 days after experiencing a panic attack. I had this panic attack in the middle of the night, triggered by the realization that the poor financial decisions I made as a single man were now negatively impacting my new wife. We couldn’t buy a home together because my credit was in such bad shape. I couldn’t even be on the loan for our house, and we almost missed out on our first home purchase because of my credit issues.\\nAs I grappled with the fact that I couldn’t help purchase our first home, it dawned on me that many of our future dreams—like having kids, buying our dream house, living in a great school district, and going on vacations—were out of reach, given our financial situation. This realization led to a panic attack at 3 a.m.\\xa0\\nDesperate for a solution, I began Googling ways to make extra money. This search led me to articles on BiggerPockets, where I saw that ordinary people were buying and owning real estate to build wealth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Plan of Action\\nAt that moment, I made a decision: I would figure out how to be a successful real estate investor no matter what. Despite having bad credit (sub-600 score) and only $1,000 in my savings account, I felt a sense of peace about this. I believed that if others on BiggerPockets could figure it out, so could I.\\nI knew I needed to surround myself with other real estate investors to propel myself down this path, so I started attending meetups, being very purposeful about which ones I went to, how often I attended, where I sat, and how I offered value to others so I could learn from them. I also began telling everyone that I was an investor. Even though I didn’t know how to be one yet, I understood that you get what you give in this world. By putting it out there that I was a real estate investor, I hoped the universe would return the favor.\\nMy First Deal\\nThis approach led to my first deal. A friend called, saying he heard I was buying houses. He had to sell his house in 30 days to purchase a property from his church and offered to sell it to me at a significant discount—$116,000 for a house worth between $165,000 and $175,000. I agreed, even though I had no idea how to proceed. I literally Googled “how to buy a house” and learned about putting it under contract.\\nWith the contract in hand, I went to the nearest bank, which was a small community bank, and asked for help. The commercial loan officer in the lobby saw it was a good deal and offered to finance it if I could provide a 15% down payment. I didn’t have the $15,000 needed, but I considered this good news. It meant I only needed $15,000 instead of $115,000.You might also likeFinding DealsWhy Successful Real Estate Investing Is All About Finding the Right DealFinding DealsHow Our Deal Broke Down at the Last Minute—And Why I’m Happy About ItFinding DealsSix Sources of Deals That Investors and Agents Can Capitalize on in Any MarketFinding DealsHow to Navigate Today’s Real Estate Market—Top Tips From Three Expert Investors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecuring My Financing\\nI reached out to my network of real estate investors from the meetups for advice on finding the money. I learned about borrowing against a 401(k) without incurring penalties and taxes. My wife had a 401(k) and agreed to borrow against it so we could buy the property. We had the money within two weeks, bought the property, and rented it out. The cash flow paid back the 401(k) loan.\\nThis experience taught me that you can get good funding if you have a good deal. The bank later offered me a line of credit on the equity in the property to use as down payments for future deals. This made me focus on finding good deals because I now had the financing in place.\\nI started studying the art of real estate investing, learning from successful investors and wholesalers about generating leads and finding deals. While I didn’t want to wholesale, I adopted this strategy to generate leads for myself. I focused on direct mail as my primary strategy but learned various methods for finding off-market and on-market deals.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nFinding the right strategy involves balancing your resources—time or money—with your personality. For me, direct mail worked best, and I consistently implemented it to find good deals. Every strategy for finding deals works; you just need to find one that suits you and stick with it.\\nThe foundation of a strong real estate business is finding good deals. A good deal with equity gives you options—whether to sell, rent, flip, or wholesale. It’s your safety net in the real estate industry.\\nThank you all for being part of my journey.

      "{'title': 'Why Successful Real Estate Investing Is All About Finding the Right Deal', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nFinding deals is one of the biggest barriers to entry in becoming a successful real estate investor.A good deal with a favorable equity spread helps mitigate risk from unknown scenarios and market fluctuations.Once you find a good deal, it's easier to pivot to other strategies when you exit your investment. \\n\\nAs you start to explore real estate investing, one of the first things you’ll hear about is the importance of finding deals. It’s a topic that dominates articles, BiggerPockets forum posts, YouTube videos, and conversations within the industry—and for good reason. Finding deals is the lifeblood of real estate investing.\\xa0\\nHere are four key reasons why a successful real estate investor focuses so much on finding the deal.\\n1. It Solves the Biggest Problem Investors Face\\nThe No. 1 reason why real estate investors are all about finding deals is that it’s the biggest challenge they face. No matter who they are, every real estate investor encounters this problem at some point. It’s one of the biggest barriers to entry in becoming a successful real estate investor.\\xa0\\nThink about the most successful businesses in the world: They found a problem that most of their audience faces and then provided a solution. If you can solve the problem of finding deals, you can essentially make money for as long as you want.\\nSolving this core need is beneficial not only for you but also for those around you. A good deal is essentially making money in real estate. You often hear the phrase, “We make money on the buy, not on the sell.” This directly points to your ability to find good deals.\\xa0\\nIf you can buy a deal properly, you’ve positioned yourself to make money. Successful real estate investors either have solved this problem or are actively working on it. As technology evolves, new opportunities for finding deals emerge, and the market shifts, requiring investors to stay on top of their game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. It’s the Best Protection Strategy\\nInvesting in any asset, whether it’s the stock market, cryptocurrency, or real estate, involves risk. The most successful real estate investors are those best prepared for these risks and who position themselves to mitigate them as much as possible. The better you mitigate risk, the more profitable you’ll be.\\nWhen it comes to real estate, buying a deal with a good equity spread is the best protection against many risks. Overpaying for a property means there’s no equity in the deal, which can lead to various problems. If the market shifts and property values drop, having a property with a good amount of equity protects you. Even if values decrease, you’re still into the property for less than it’s worth, giving you options to sell or rent without taking a loss.\\n3. It’s the Lowest Common Denominator Among All Exit Strategies\\nAll exit strategies—flipping houses, long-term rentals, mid-term rentals, short-term rentals, and wholesaling—require one thing: a good deal. If you focus on finding good deals, you can pivot among different strategies as needed, whether you’re flipping, renting, or wholesaling.\\nBuying a good deal means you can monetize the property in whatever way makes sense for you. If you want to be a landlord, you need a property that will cash flow. If you want to flip, you need a deal with enough spread to make a profit.\\xa0\\nThe common denominator for any successful strategy is buying a good deal.You might also likeFinding DealsFrom a Panic Attack To My First Deal in Just 90 Days: How I Mastered Real Estate Deal FindingFinding DealsHow Our Deal Broke Down at the Last Minute—And Why I’m Happy About ItFinding DealsSix Sources of Deals That Investors and Agents Can Capitalize on in Any MarketFinding DealsHow to Navigate Today’s Real Estate Market—Top Tips From Three Expert Investors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. It’s the Trigger Point for Everything Else in Real Estate Investing\\nFinding a good deal is the trigger point that makes everything else in real estate investing relevant. To purchase property, renovate it, and rent it out, you need connections—financing, contractors, and title companies. But having a good deal makes lining up these connections easier.\\nWithout a deal, getting banks to discuss loan products, contractors to provide bids, or title companies to assist is challenging. However, when you have a good deal, banks, contractors, and title companies are more willing to work with you. A good deal gives you leverage to get everything else in place.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nSuccessful real estate investors focus on finding the deal because it’s the biggest problem new investors face, the best protection strategy, the lowest common denominator for any exit strategy, and the trigger point that makes everything else easier.\\xa0\\nI hope this helps.

      "{'title': 'The Real Impact of 0% Down Mortgages and How an Investor Could Use One…or Not', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaise your hand if you got burned by real estate in 2008. You can’t see it, but I’m raising my hands, feet, and even the hairs on my neck.\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) recently made news by launching a 0%-down mortgage program. And it reminds many real estate analysts of the subprime mortgage frenzy that helped fuel the market collapse back in 2008.\\xa0\\nSo, as you scope out the new program, what’s the potential impact on real estate investors?\\xa0\\nA Summary of UWM’s 0%-Down Program\\nFirst, let’s start with the facts. The program allows lower-income first-time borrowers—those earning a household income below 80% of the local median household income—to borrow up to 97% of the purchase price. The remaining 3%, or what would ordinarily be the down payment, UWM covers with an interest-free second mortgage.\\xa0\\nBorrowers don’t make monthly payments against the second mortgage. When they sell or refinance the property, they must repay both the first and second mortgages in full.\\xa0\\nThis sounds like an awesome deal for the borrower. All things being equal, I’d take that deal as a borrower. Who doesn’t love interest-free financing?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat About House Hacking?\\nThe first thought that popped into my head when BiggerPockets asked me for my thoughts on how this loan program might impact investors was, “Wow, that’d be great for house hacking.”\\nIf you could buy a duplex, triplex, or fourplex with no money down and have it cash flow enough to cover your mortgage payment, you immediately step into free housing and a property that appreciates over time. And your mortgage payment stays fixed even as rents rise year after year, growing your cash flow over time.\\xa0\\nAfter a year of living in the property to fulfill the owner occupancy requirements, you could then use the money you saved on housing payments to buy another multifamily to house hack. You couldn’t use the UWM program a second time, but you could use Fannie Mae’s or Freddie Mac’s 3% down program or put down 3.5% on an FHA loan. And you would no longer be confined by the income limit at that point.\\xa0\\nEven so, that income limit would disqualify many, even most would-be house hackers. Food for thought.\\xa0\\nRisks and Impacts of 0% Down Mortgage Programs\\nI see a few risks with these kinds of programs, as well as their impacts on a few different groups. Here’s a look at them.\\nRisk of inflated home prices and bubbles\\nFor many would-be homeowners, the down payment creates the main barrier to entry. Remove that barrier, and you suddenly have an influx of new buyers on the market. This drives up home prices and adds to the possibility of a housing bubble.\\xa0\\nAll market bubbles burst sooner or later. And it wouldn’t even require a bubble or a housing market correction to put a lot of homeowners underwater.\\nRisk of underwater homes\\nIn this case, home prices dipping even 3% would put these homeowners underwater on their mortgage. And that says nothing of all the closing costs involved in selling a home.\\xa0\\nThey would be unable to sell, at least not without coming out of pocket with tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. This seems awfully unlikely for the low-income borrowers this program is designed to serve.\\xa0\\nThat sets the stage for strategic defaults and foreclosures—or, at the very least, short sales negotiated with lenders. These lenders may struggle to accommodate them in a down market.You might also likeOpinionThe Government Has Taken a Permanent Intellectual Vacation—This New Plan is Evident of ThatOpinionThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate—and Lessons From ItOpinionNo, Cash is Not King—You Can Do Way More and Way Better With FinancingOpinionBrian Took the Easy Way Out—Here’s Why He Made a Big Mistake and Why I’m Never Selling My Properties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk of credit crunches and lender failures\\nIf too many loans default or require short sales, lenders go into crisis mode. They tighten their lending standards or stop lending altogether.\\xa0\\nSome may even fold. We saw two regional banks fail in early 2023 due to commercial real estate exposure and far tighter lending standards in the industry after that.\\xa0\\nFinally, these loans get packaged and sold as securities. So, who ultimately takes many of the losses on them? You, me, pension funds, and other retail investors who have money tied up in these publicly traded funds and securities.\\xa0\\nImpact on note and debt investors\\nOver the last two years, secured notes and debts have actually performed pretty well. We’ve seen strong returns on the ones we’ve gone in on together in our passive real estate investment club at SparkRental.\\nBut imagine a housing bubble forms, or at the very least, the market dips by 5% to 10% nationwide. Hard money lenders, private debt funds, and others offering secured debts will see their non-performing loans skyrocket and, therefore, their losses. That would be bad news for people like me who invest passively in debts secured by real estate.\\xa0\\nImpact on private equity real estate investors\\nIn our Co-Investing Club, we primarily go in on real estate syndications together.\\xa0\\nA 2008-style housing-induced recession would drive up unemployment, which would, in turn, drive up rent defaults, evictions, and household bundling—all bad news.\\xa0\\nOne mitigating factor, if you want to call it that, is that some homeowners would become renters again, fueling demand for rental housing. But that’s cold comfort for everyone involved.\\xa0\\nOn the other end of the possibility spectrum, let’s say the program does exactly what it aims to do: put homeownership within reach for millions of renters. They all leave the pool of renters and become homeowners, crushing demand for rental housing.\\xa0\\nThat’s hardly good news for passive investors in multifamily real estate syndications.\\xa0\\nActivists Want It Both Ways\\nWe’ve all heard housing activists demand better access to homeownership for low-income families. I’m not opposed to that. I can’t think of anyone who is.\\xa0\\nBut here’s the problem: Read any article about the launch of UWM’s 0%-down loan program, and you’ll see quotes from those same housing activists warning about “setting buyers up for failure,” or “ticking time bombs,” or “the subprime nightmare all over again.”\\nGuess what? Subprime mortgages were created at the request of those same housing activists, who demanded more credit accessibility for low-income borrowers. They wanted fewer barriers to entry.\\xa0\\nThose barriers to entry keep the system stable. They ensure a minimum level of financial security among borrowers.\\xa0\\nSo which is it? Do you want homeownership more accessible, or less? You can’t have it both ways.\\xa0\\nWhat About Investors?\\nAs for real estate investors, just keep an eye on real estate market fundamentals. Watch out for frothiness. And when in doubt, invest more conservatively.

      "{'title': 'Zero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage launched a new zero-down mortgage program available for first-time homebuyers.The program allows borrowers who qualify to get a mortgage and a second loan to cover the cost of the down payment up to $15,000.\\xa0While a few of these programs exist in different formats, critics warn that it could be the beginning of another housing crisis similar to 2008. \\n\\nWith housing prices and mortgage rates rising, it’s becoming harder for the average person to own a home, let alone invest in a second property. One mortgage lender has introduced a 0% down program in the hopes of attracting more buyers. While some critics are worried it’s similar to the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial crash, others say it’s nothing new.\\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) announced its zero-down program in May. This program allows borrowers who qualify to get a mortgage and a second loan to cover the cost of the down payment. Borrowers can get a 3% down payment assistance loan of up to $15,000.\\xa0\\nThis second loan will not accrue interest or have a monthly payment. Instead, the loan has to be paid back in full if the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off, or the borrower refinances.\\nHomebuyers who want to take advantage of this program will need to be at or below 80% of the property address’s area median income or be a first-time buyer.\\nIs This a Repeat of the 2008 Housing Crisis?\\nWhile UWM says no other wholesale lender is offering this type of program nationally, programs have been in place for years that assist buyers with low or no down payments, such as bond programs, housing authority assistance on a local level, and veteran loans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also offers zero-down home loans in some rural areas, while Bank of America launched a zero-down mortgage program in 2022 for some Black and Hispanic communities.\\nStill, only a few of these programs exist, and they have many more controls that were set in place after the financial crisis. Lenders can no longer provide 100% financing on stated income, Lindsey Harn, a real estate agent in California, told BiggerPockets. “There is oversight on the financing, which far exceeds previous efforts,” she said. “Lenders and banks are held to strict ‘ability to repay’ guidelines, which hold them accountable to ensuring that a borrower has the stability and means to meet their debt obligations.”\\nJosh Brotemarkle, president and general counsel at Centra Capital Partners, told BiggerPockets that the real estate boom seen during the early 2000s was partly fueled by interest-only mortgages, which, like zero-down mortgages, assume that real estate will appreciate in value. But real estate can depreciate, and people are likely to walk away if they owe more than the home is valued at.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile zero-down mortgages can help homebuyers purchase a new home, these programs are not without risk, he added.\\n“The price to pay for programs that seek to curtail traditional lending practices is paid with a currency called ‘moral hazard,’” Brotemarkle explained. “Moral hazard occurs when people act in risky ways because they do not bear the full consequence of their actions. When borrowers are not at risk, they are less likely to care.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan Investors Benefit From Zero-Down Mortgages?\\nUWM’s zero-down program is aimed at homebuyers struggling to purchase a property, but that doesn’t mean investors can’t take advantage to buy a second property, provided they meet the requirements. Other zero-down programs could also be worth looking into, although their strict eligibility requirements and income requirements often mean that very few real estate investors qualify.\\xa0\\nA down payment is one of the biggest barriers to real estate investing, and these loan products can help a lot of people build their wealth, Nicholas Ritacco, portfolio manager and director at IB Global, told BiggerPockets. “If investors can find options that work for them, I believe they have to do so with the right plan,” he added.\\nStill, many real estate experts say a zero-down mortgage might not make investment sense, as not putting any money down means you are starting out with little equity. One of the biggest risks is that these programs offer very high loan-to-value loans and are essentially all debt, said Ritacco. It also doesn’t allow investors to refinance with an option to cash out.\\nHarn agreed, as zero-down programs “are too restrictive in rate to make sense as a business model.”\\n“A sufficient down payment and reserves should be used to ensure a property can adequately cover its debt service,” she added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Houston is the most at risk southern city.Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, says the key is knowing exactly what your insurance policy covers and mitigating your risks based on that. \\n\\n\\nHurricane season has started, and forecasts are not looking good. According to analytics company CoreLogic, more than 32.7 million homes from Texas to Maine are at risk of hurricane damage this year.\\nThe season is expected to be very busy and possibly top the record books for the number of storms named. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts there could be as many as 25 total storms, with eight to 13 becoming hurricanes.\\nExperts say the ocean is warming around the world. At the same time, the end of one of the strongest El Ninos ever observed could quickly transition to a La Nina, which generally causes more hurricanes over the Atlantic. The combination of warm weather and high winds could mean the perfect recipe for stronger storms this season.\\xa0\\nMetro Areas Most at Risk of Hurricane and Storm Surges\\nWhile it’s impossible to know exactly who will be impacted this hurricane season, some areas could be harder hit than others, while not all homes will experience a total loss. Some could be damaged by flooding and storm surges, and others by wind.\\nCoreLogic’s 2024 Hurricane Risk Report identified the areas most at risk of damage from hurricane winds and storm surges. Areas with high population density in low-lying coastal areas are most at risk. However, how much a property could be damaged depends on various factors, such as elevation changes and any barriers to block water from moving inland.\\xa0\\nHere’s a look at places with the most risk of damage from hurricane winds, as well as the reconstruction value from such phenomena.\\nMetro AreaNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to hurricane windsReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York3,765,489$1.961Philadelphia, Pennsylvania1,657,757$703.6Houston, Texas2,092,308$671.3Boston, Massachusetts1,347,819$669.5Miami, Florida2,048,827$511.4Tampa, Florida1,107,320$294.5Providence, Rhode Island483,033$211.7Virginia Beach, Virginia583,928$186.4Jacksonville, Florida580,352$167.9Richmond, Virginia435,597$153.6Hartford, Connecticut353,537$150.3Bridgeport, Connecticut212,853$135.8New Orleans, Louisiana442,099$135.1North Port, Florida398,672$107.7\\nMany of the metro areas with the most at-risk homes also tend to be in areas that are familiar with hurricane damage. Hurricane Sandy, for example, caused an estimated $19 billion in damages and lost economic activity across New York City in 2012. As the most densely populated city in the U.S., it’s not a surprise that it tops the list of the most homes at risk of damage from storm surges and hurricane winds.\\nHere’s a look at those places most likely to see coastal flooding, as well as the reconstruction value.\\nNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to storm surgeReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York878,226$415.4Virginia Beach, Virginia396,843$124.8Miami, Florida509,133$124.0Tampa, Florida448,013$109.5New Orleans, Louisiana320,908$99.3Cape Coral, Florida318,004$78.4North Port, Florida254,218$64.6Boston, Massachusetts148,005$59.5Naples, Florida196,454$54.9Charleston, South Carolina148,987$53.3Houston, Texas192,937$52.6Jacksonville, Florida154,177$46.1Philadelphia, Pennsylvania120,426$42.1Salisbury, Maryland138,295$40.9\\nOther metro areas, such as Miami and Houston, are also familiar with hurricanes. According to NOAA’s historical trackers, there have been 48 and 28 hurricanes within 60 nautical miles of Miami and Houston’s counties since the beginning of the 20th century.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Protect Your Property During Hurricane Season\\nFor homeowners and real estate investors who own property in areas that are more prone to hurricane and storm damage, it’s essential to understand and know the risks these storms present to your property, Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, told BiggerPockets. “When you know your risk, you can accelerate your recovery,” she added.\\nShe added that the other key to preparing is to understand your insurance policy, knowing what is covered and what isn’t. For example, flood insurance is not mandatory unless the property is mortgaged and in a FEMA-designated flood zone. If a property is damaged by flooding and isn’t covered, you could end up footing the bill yourself.\\n“As we have seen from events like Hurricane Harvey in 2017, flooding damage can be extreme and often not limited to designated flood zones, so understanding what is covered is critical. That’s not something you want to find out after a home has sustained hurricane damage,” Bolton-Smith said.\\nBesides insurance, you can also fortify your home, such as making sure the roof is in good condition and there are no loose shingles, as well as ensuring there are no large trees or other items that could damage your home, she added.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes It Still Make Sense to Buy In Areas Prone to Climate Disasters?\\xa0\\nHurricanes and other climate disasters have been more frequent and extreme in recent years. This increases the risk of potential property damage and costs—and has caused insurance premiums to skyrocket in many areas. And it seems that this trend will only get worse, with as many as 40 million homes at risk of a spike in insurance premiums.\\xa0\\n“The reality is, risk of some kind is present in most places,” said Bolton-Smith. She lives in California, which faces both earthquake and wildfire risks. And while it’s unlikely a hurricane would hit every area mentioned in CoreLogic’s report, there is a chance of multiple disaster events in one year.\\nStill, technology and building codes have greatly improved to ensure that homes are fortified against risk, such as with magnesium siding or reinforced doors and windows.\\nUltimately, “I think it comes down to understanding the potential risk and deciding whether you’re comfortable with it and knowing what resources you have to mitigate it,” Bolton-Smith said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Data-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is presented by PropStream. Read our\\xa0editorial guidelines\\xa0for more information.\\nThe housing market is an increasingly challenging place for investors right now. The costs of investing in real estate are undoubtedly rising, with more funds required both upfront and on an ongoing basis. Additionally, competition for good investment leads is fierce amid an ongoing shortage of homes for sale.\\nFortunately, there are solutions to these challenges. They lie in the realm of precision data collection and analysis.\\nTop Real Estate Challenges in 2024\\nHere, we will cover the most pressing challenges facing real estate investors right now, and the ways in which data-backed tools can help them make game-changing tweaks to their investing strategies.\\xa0\\nLow inventory\\nThe challenge of low inventory is persistent, with no current indicators that it will improve anytime soon. Low inventory has shaped the U.S. housing market since the spike in interest rates from the historic low of 2.65% in 2021. Since then, interest rates have tripled with a high of over 8%, causing homeowner reluctance to sell due to the lock-in effect. Home sales have slowed dramatically since 2022.\\xa0\\nThe fact remains that current interest rates just cannot compete with the historically low rates homeowners locked in before 2022. Homeowners are hesitant to move and take on mortgages with much higher rates; their reluctance to sell is completely understandable. And although there are signs that interest rates are stabilizing, we’re just not there yet in terms of what sellers would like to see—and we won’t be there in 2024.\\xa0\\nAs Rick Sharga, founder, and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a market intelligence and business advisory firm, told Forbes, “I don’t expect to see a meaningful increase in the supply of existing homes for sale until mortgage rates are back down in the low-5% range, so probably not in 2024.”\\nLow inventory will continue propping up high home prices, and this will continue to present real estate investors with the challenge of finding affordable investment opportunities. However, there are ways investors can expand lead generation and maximize investment opportunities without having to wait for inventory to grow. The key is to identify off-market properties that are owned by motivated sellers—people who want to and have to sell sooner rather than later and will be more flexible on selling price.\\xa0\\nEnter PropStream. Its powerful data-filtering tools allows investors to search any market in the U.S. (over 155 million properties), identifying off-market properties with motivated homeowners who need to sell based on over 120 filter options.\\xa0\\nThis granular approach means that an investor can have a much better understanding of what exactly is motivating a particular seller. A seller motivated by financial distress and/or threat of foreclosure requires a different approach from one desiring a home upgrade or a retiring homeowner wanting to downsize.\\xa0\\nIdentifying motivated sellers with precision allows a potential investor to tailor the best possible offer that will be effective and attractive to the specific seller. This is a much better lead strategy overall than relying only on SEO and outbound marketing or referrals.\\xa0\\nTraditional lead-generation methods simply do not capture the entirety of existing opportunities. As an investor, you also can really stand out from the crowd if you are making a personalized offer that takes the seller’s specific circumstances into account.\\xa0\\nHigh interest rates\\nHigh interest rates hit investors, too, not just regular buyers. Inevitably, those higher monthly mortgage payments have to translate into higher rent charges, which can make it more difficult for investors to find and retain tenants.\\nTo illustrate the point, the average monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. reached $2,268 in 2023, an almost 50% hike from only two years before, when the average monthly payment was only $1,525.\\nHigher mortgage costs, coupled with rising home insurance costs, is bad news for investors at a time when rent growth is sluggish across the country. The solution? Access to more—and more accurate—data that will help investors identify better deals and combat the problem of higher monthly payments.\\xa0\\nFor example, filtering a property search by mortgage type, rate, and mortgage balance can help you zoom in on investment opportunities where an existing, low-rate mortgage could be transferred to you or where the mortgage balance is low and can be paid off sooner, making your investment more profitable in the longer term.\\nPropStream provides deep-dive insights into 155 million-plus properties nationwide, including mortgage and financial data. Armed with mortgage related information, you can make better investment decisions and achieve higher ROIs.\\xa0\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020—How Should You Approach Deals Now?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, it’s never wise to make an investment decision solely based on lower monthly payments. You may be focusing in on an area where there aren’t suitable properties with transferable mortgages, for instance.\\xa0\\nThe solution here is not to write off suitable leads with high-interest rate mortgages but to look into more financing options. Creative financing can be a viable option, for example.\\xa0\\nRemember: As an investor, you are not necessarily as constrained by a budget as a buyer who plans to live at a property. If the home is a lucrative investment opportunity and ticks all the other boxes, it can be worth it to secure alternative financing.\\xa0\\nHigh competition for affordable investment opportunities\\nFinally, there is no way around the fact that the overall higher cost of housing across the U.S. is leading to lower returns, creating a feeding frenzy among investors for more affordable properties. Everybody wants below-market-value homes, and when these hit the market, fierce competition ensues.\\xa0\\nMany investors rely on their local agents and the MLS to locate less expensive investment opportunities. The problem is that even if you have a good relationship with the agent and they have promised to alert you to new opportunities, it may just come down to where you are on their list of multiple investors.\\xa0\\nThe solution? Stop competing, and look where no one else is. You have to search beneath the tip of the iceberg for properties that haven’t yet been put on the market but could be soon.\\xa0\\nWhat you need to do is identify homeowners with a high propensity to sell in your area, gather relevant data about the situation and the property, and then craft an offer that both gives the homeowner confidence to sell and gives them a valuable solution to whatever issue they may be having with the property.\\xa0\\nIt’s important to stress that you’re not necessarily or exclusively looking at pre-foreclosure properties. A homeowner may be reluctant to sell because of the repairs the home needs (which they feel they can’t afford) or because they have an insurance problem. There are a whole range of situations out there, and it should be your goal as an investor to tailor the best possible outcome for both yourself and the seller.\\xa0\\nUtilizing PropStream’s data, you can identify properties that present profitable opportunities based on sellers’ current situations. Once you’ve located homeowners likely to want to sell, you can put yourself in a strong negotiating position by having access to the right data about the property.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout PropStream\\nPropStream® is the most trusted provider of comprehensive real estate data nationwide.

      "{'title': 'A Massive Commercial to Residential Conversion is Taking Shape Nationwide—Here’s What Investors Should Know', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nCommercial spaces are set to convert into 151,000 new apartments this year, up from 122,000 last year.Hotels are leading the way for conversions in destination cities like New York and Los Angeles.11% of offices are primed for conversion, but the costs are so high that owners would need to charge luxury prices, which won't do much to help affordability. \\n\\nFrom the boardroom to the bedroom, faced with empty offices as remote employment continues to starve cities of workers, a massive nationwide repurposing is underway to transform workplaces into residential spaces.\\xa0\\nAccording to a report by\\xa0RentCafe, “adaptive reuse”—the term for this process—will see 151,000 new apartments take shape this year, up from 122,000 last year, representing a 24% increase and a 17.6% increase from the year before.\\xa0\\nThe trend is much needed to stop building owners from going broke and cities from losing much-needed tax revenue. A study completed in November 2022 by researchers at the NYU Stern School of Business and Columbia University estimated a\\xa0$664.1 billion reduction\\xa0in real estate asset values from continued\\xa0remote work trends.\\nNew York and LA Head Conversions\\nMost of that number involves repurposing hotels—an easier\\xa0transformation than remaking office spaces, which are also being converted, with Manhattan leading the charge. A small number involve converting industrial buildings such as factories. By far, the largest project in Manhattan is 525 Lexington Avenue. The building now houses 655 student apartments.\\nLos Angeles has 5,881 units scheduled for conversion this year, while Manhattan has 4,363. Office conversions are at the top of many cities’ agendas. Because of the\\xa0additional considerations, such as windows, plumbing, and electrical revisions, office conversions take longer than hotel conversions. However, they are still considered an environmentally friendly alternative to razing buildings and starting from scratch.\\xa0\\n“The process minimizes the environmental impact associated with demolition and the production of new materials, making it an eco-friendly approach to design and construction,” Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at commercial real estate data firm Yardi Matrix, said in the press release about the RentCafe report. “Although these [office] buildings pose challenges for conversion into residential spaces due to factors like building age, size, configuration, and location, repurposing them helps alleviate the shortage of rental units at diverse price points, especially in areas where vacant or underused buildings are prevalent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTax Revenue, Housing, and Vitality\\nThe immediate advantages of additional city residential spaces include:\\n\\nMore tax revenue.\\nVibrant 24/7 communities.\\nBooming business for nearby restaurants and businesses.\\nA much healthier urban ecosystem.\\n\\nAbout\\xa011%\\xa0of U.S. office buildings are good candidates for conversion, but one\\xa0of the prohibitive issues\\xa0is expense. The resultant apartments or condos would need to be high-end to pay for the undertaking. This\\xa0would do nothing to alleviate the affordability crisis many cities are facing.\\xa0\\nHowever, a\\xa0study from Gensler\\xa0indicates that office conversions are less than one-third of the cost of new construction. Couple this with developer incentives, such as new\\xa0legislation\\xa0that provides a 20% credit for qualified property conversion expenditures with developers—providing at least 20% of the resulting units are affordable housing to qualify—and large-scale office conversions could provide a way to revitalize city centers, offering much-needed affordable housing in the process.\\nThe Benefit for Real Estate Investors\\nIn the short term, the additional tax revenue allows cities to function better. It means residential landlords in the city boroughs won’t see a spike in their real estate taxes, and essential city services such as sanitation, police, education, and fire departments will be better funded, making cities better places to live. Also, adding affordable, much-needed inventory to the market could stabilize and even decrease exorbitant, escalating prices, allowing more people to\\xa0get onto\\xa0the housing ladder and create more well-balanced cities of full-time residents.\\xa0\\nIn the long term, as cities become desirable places to live and socialize, as has happened in cities like\\xa0Detroit, the knock-on effect benefits the entire\\xa0city, resulting in appreciating real estate values.\\xa0\\nInvesting in City Condos\\xa0\\nInvesting in condos is an excellent strategy for passive income.\\xa0According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price of single-family homes rose 5.6% to $412,100 from April 2023, while the median sales price of condominiums increased 5.4% to $365,300.\\xa0\\nThough city condos could be pricier than they are elsewhere, the fact that owners pay a maintenance fee means the public areas of the building and grounds and amenities are well maintained, saving an investor the headaches associated with single-family homes. As with other real estate types, condos appreciate while providing\\xa0cash flow\\xa0and tax breaks.\\xa0\\nThe downside of condos is that because of the minimal upkeep, overseas investors often buy them in all-cash deals as a haven to park their money while living elsewhere, leaving many buildings half-occupied.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Big Picture\\nAccording to commercial real estate brokerage\\xa0JLL, repurposing office buildings for residential and other in-demand uses could provide a windfall for commercial real estate investors. Indeed, 90% of global real estate investors believe a former office’s best\\xa0uses would be\\xa0residential assets.\\xa0\\nOther uses mentioned include:\\n\\nIndustrial storage and data centers.\\nHospitality and leisure.\\nStudent or senior housing.\\n\\nThat said, assuming\\xa0the construction aspect of a conversion could be achieved, financial hurdles could\\xa0still\\xa0pose a problem.\\n“If an office was acquired using an office-specific investment fund, pivoting to a different use often requires first selling the property and securing alternative financing,” Raphaelle Bour,\\xa0lead project manager of Work Dynamics, said on the JLL website.\\xa0Noting the number of cities getting on board with tax incentives and zoning allowances, Bour added: “Policymakers are also simplifying previous conversion hurdles, hoping to reduce the number of stranded assets whose upgrade costs outweigh their worth.”\\nValue-Add Propositions of Older Buildings Can Offset Risk\\xa0\\n“There’s an opportunity for investors to acquire vacant office buildings, structure the repurposing, and establish new operators,” says Bour. “They can then offer assets to the market with, say, a decade of secure cash flow,\\xa0something\\xa0which is currently in high demand—and many large investors are creating diversified funds for this type of operation.”\\nFinal Thoughts\\nRepurposing office buildings offers\\xa0opportunities for both\\xa0smaller residential and more prominent\\xa0commercial investors.\\xa0For owners of small\\xa0multifamily\\xa0buildings, a big city’s ongoing healthy social and financial ecosystem means a plentiful supply of tenants, the upkeep of essential services, and increasing housing values.\\nFor\\xa0passive investors, the supply of new condos to the market offers the opportunity to invest in a hands-off, appreciating asset. Depending on your city’s\\xa0short-term rental\\xa0rules, this asset could be used as an Airbnb, allowing you to stay in your residence when you are in town.\\nFor larger-scale investors and syndications, the myriad of potential adaptive uses for older office buildings means that not only will there be financial benefits for a value-added proposition, but also the chance to choose a future-proof, in-demand business such as a data center that is not tenant-dependent and thus less risky than relying on constant upkeep, monthly rents, and high occupancy numbers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet a Better Tax Strategy Now\\nFind a trusted, investor-friendly tax professional who knows how to maximize real estate tax savings.\\n\\nFind a Tax Pro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote By BiggerPockets: These are opinions written by the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of BiggerPockets.\\n\\n\"}\n",

Forgiving lenders don’t want to be saddled with foreclosed properties they can’t sell,\\xa0and so\\xa0are holding off on court proceedings. Remaining tenants who are current with rents are holding on, allowing buildings to stay afloat—for the time being.\\xa0\\nHowever, without fully rented buildings, limping\\xa0along\\xa0on borrowed time means maintenance issues will mount, and finding insurance on an almost insolvent building is challenging. Many landlords who\\xa0can\\xa0see the writing on the wall have decided to cut their losses. The\\xa0New York Times\\xa0reported that many commercial buildings\\xa0around the country\\xa0are\\xa0being sold\\xa0at a 50% to 80% discount.\\nAs the cycle continues, it’s not just commercial landlords of skyscrapers who are feeling the pinch. Landlords and businesses throughout major cities are hurting as workers move, and municipal budgets that rely on taxes associated with valuable commercial property face shortfalls as lower property tax assessments cut revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Empty Offices Affect Cities and Small Residential Landlords\\nWhen people no longer need to live in cities to work, the entire infrastructure of that city suffers, including smaller landlords who provide housing. Although the lack of inventory and high interest rates have forced people to keep renting instead of buying, it’s not surprising that there has been a\\xa0huge\\xa0movement away from expensive Northern cities since the pandemic.\\xa0\\nAccording to census data, New York City has been most affected, with\\xa078,000 people leaving in 2023. Overall, the state of New York lost 102,000 people. Most people leaving New York were not millionaires but the lower and middle class, earning between $32,000 and $65,000 who, without the need to\\xa0be tethered\\xa0to a costly city, were happy to give up high rents and cold weather.\\nHow Empty Offices Could Impact Banks and Loans for Other Smaller Investors\\nAccording to\\xa0Moody’s Analytics, the national office vacancy rate reached\\xa0a record\\xa019.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\xa0Not since\\xa01979\\xa0had offices been so empty.\\xa0\\nIf landlords foreclose or sell for less than they owe, that could spell big problems for banks that hold a lot of commercial real estate debt. The aftershocks could be felt throughout the\\xa0whole\\xa0lending industry, affecting smaller landlords seeking real estate loans.\\xa0\\n“We saw this play out last year: A bank gets in trouble, and that creates uncertainty in the market,” Dan Roccato, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego, told\\xa0CBS. “That uncertainty ripples through the stock market, that uncertainty ripples through the real estate market, and that uncertainty then shows up in your 401(k) plan at the end of the month.”\\xa0\\nThe result could be cities looking to make up the tax income shortfall from distressed and discounted commercial building sales by increasing revenue from residential property or sales taxes.\\nThe Waiting Game Gets Harder\\n“Survive until ‘25” is not a phrase any landlords struggling with high interest rates would have expected to hear at the start of the year when the Fed first touted a\\xa0series of rate cuts. However,\\xa0inflation‘s stubborn grip on the U.S. economy and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s steadfast position on refusing to cut rates until it falls has investors, homeowners, and many politicians\\xa0wringing their hands\\xa0in despair.\\xa0\\nAs we have seen from distressed commercial real estate sales and syndications with floating-rate\\xa0mortgages, holding on to underwater debt has become increasingly difficult. Banks, too, are feeling the heat, having to carry debt expected to\\xa0be paid off. On average, commercial real estate loans make up more than a fifth of U.S. banks’ overall loan portfolios. Many commercial landlords cough up borrowed cash to extend their loans until rates drop.\\xa0\\nAccording to CRED iQ analysis, New York landlords SL Green and Vornado had to find around\\xa0$100 million to extend\\xa0a $1.08 billion loan on an office building at 280 Park Avenue\\xa0in April.\\xa0Other owners have decided they can no longer afford to keep servicing the debt and would do better to deploy their money elsewhere.\\xa0This\\xa0is similar to what happened in the financial crash of 2008. Waiting in vain has its limits.\\n“Last year, borrowers were saying, ‘I just need three months for rate cuts to kick in,'” Alex Killick, a managing director at real estate services company CWCapital Asset Management, told the\\xa0Wall Street Journal. “We aren’t hearing that anymore. Powell sounded pretty clear that this is the new normal.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nLetting properties go is always the last option for investors when the financial strain becomes unbearable. What frustrates many commercial property owners is that the Fed teased rate cuts and\\xa0then\\xa0backed off. They will inevitably happen, but when is the all-important question?\\nIn the meantime, the ropes tethering commercial buildings, lenders, owners, and an entire real estate infrastructure are starting to give, threatening businesses, livelihoods, and cities.\\xa0\\nAlthough no one saw the pandemic coming, the aftershocks must make politicians and landlords better prepared to handle other black swan events. At the root of it all are interest rates, fueling rampant inflation caused by the Fed’s easy money policy.\\nOther countries\\xa0have recovered more quickly from the pandemic than the U.S., without the inflation and rate hikes.\\xa0Lessons must be learned.\\xa0\\nIn the meantime, Jerome Powell needs to offer the nation some hope.

      "{'title': 'Yes, Tiny Homes Could Be the Most Cost-Effective Way to Cash Flow Right Now—Here’s Why', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBigger is\\xa0not always\\xa0better, especially\\xa0when it comes to\\xa0homes and mortgage payments.\\xa0High interest rates and soaring house prices have made developers, homeowners, and investors consider going smaller to make big money.\\xa0\\n“The monthly payment matters more than anything else, and builders have responded with smaller, more efficient homes,” John Burns, chief executive with Irvine, California-based firm\\xa0John Burns Research and Consulting, told the\\xa0New York Times.\\xa0\\nThe same article reveals that the median new U.S. home peaked at around 2,500 square feet in 2015. New homes have since shed about 200 square feet as costs rose, urban living boomed, and families got smaller. The current affordability crisis has shrunk the envelope even more, and many real estate investors have realized that they need to downsize the square footage of their investment homes to cash flow.\\nWhat Is a Tiny Home?\\nBut first, what is the definition of a tiny home?\\xa0\\nA tiny home is generally a dwelling that measures less than 400 square feet. Many\\xa0are constructed\\xa0on trailers, which makes them mobile. However, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and other small dwellings, such as cottages and in-law suites, can also be classified as tiny homes if they fit the rough dimensions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Cost of Building a Tiny Home\\nOn average,\\xa0building a tiny home costs\\xa0a minimum of\\xa0$20,000, which is around 4% of the average\\xa0U.S. home sale price.\\xa0Custom-built homes with add-ons can double the price of a tiny\\xa0home, and a\\xa0home\\xa0on wheels usually costs between $60,000 and $80,000.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt’s worth noting that if your tiny home is mobile and located in your primary residence’s garden, you will not need to pay\\xa0property taxes. If it is on a foundation on a separate parcel of land, you\\xa0will need to\\xa0factor in the cost of buying the land and property taxes into your expenses.\\xa0\\nROI and Cash Flow\\nWith an outlay of over $100,000, what type of\\xa0cash flow\\xa0can you earn on a tiny home used for an investment? Much of it depends on your home’s location. If it is by a beach in a popular tourist destination, near a lake in a picturesque countryside, or in a major city in a home’s back garden, expect to earn high rents.\\xa0\\nAccording to short-term rental analytics site\\xa0AirDNA, Getaway, a start-up that rents tiny prefab cabins for $129 to $299 a night, raised $41.7 million in 2021. The cost of each cabin was around $40,000 per Airbnb investment.\\xa0\\nTechCrunch\\xa0revealed that Gateway experienced a nearly 100% occupancy rate for their properties. Rounding off the numbers for convenience, assuming\\xa0each home was rented\\xa0for $200/night for 300 nights per year, amounts to a total yearly income of $60,000 per year, which would pay off the cost of the cabin in its first year, with $20,000 left over for additional expenses.\\xa0\\nAirbnb co-founder\\xa0Joe Gebbia started Samara in 2022, a company specializing in prefab ADUs. This further points to the growing popularity of tiny houses as investments. By placing an ADU in their backyard, homeowners can forgo the expense of real estate taxes and earn extra money without having strangers in their living space.\\nCities Are Getting on Board the Tiny House Explosion\\nExpensive cities see ADUs as a way to alleviate their housing crises.\\xa0Although prohibitive short-term rental laws mean\\xa0they cannot be used\\xa0in places such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York for less than 30 days, they are a much-needed housing pressure valve for conventional yearly lease tenants or\\xa0for\\xa0homeowners in need of\\xa0more space.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADUs Could Be Great for Homeowners in Pricey Cities\\nCalifornia passed a series of laws in 2016 to make ADUs\\xa0easier\\xa0to build in the state by overriding local zoning and land use restrictions, enabling backyard homes. Los Angeles also\\xa0tried to spur the construction of ADUs\\xa0by experimenting with new financing methods and other solutions. New York City will help finance the construction of ADUs under its\\xa0Plus One ADU program\\xa0with no- or low-interest loans. Although tiny homes on wheels are\\xa0illegal in New York City, ADUs, which occupy backyards on already-owned homes, are allowed.\\nIt could be a fantastic way for homeowners to\\xa0bring in\\xa0extra income in a high-cost rental city.\\xa0As NYC’s Housing Preservation & Development website states:\\xa0“ADUs can serve a number of different purposes, providing housing to family members or serving as an added source of income for household expenses by renting an additional unit.”\\nIn major cities, however, the cost of constructing an ADU increases dramatically compared to that of a tiny home.\\xa0For example, Samara’s studio\\xa0starts at\\xa0$289,000, and the one-bedroom unit\\xa0starts at\\xa0$329,000, including installation costs.\\nMultiple states\\xa0have tiny home-friendly development laws, including:\\n\\nCalifornia\\nFlorida\\nGeorgia\\nKansas\\nNorth Carolina\\nOregon\\nTexas\\n\\nHowever, tiny homes are illegal in the following states:\\n\\nAlaska\\nIowa\\nLouisiana\\nNew Jersey\\nNew York\\nNorth Dakota\\nWest Virginia\\nWisconsin\\n\\nThinking Big\\nIf you’re thinking about instantly scaling your tiny home business, mobile home parks and trailer parks are good places to start because the grounds are already zoned for and equipped with amenities for\\xa0small\\xa0homes. It’s\\xa0fairly\\xa0straightforward to buy plots of land and replace existing trailers with tiny houses, which are modern, sustainable, and more livable than trailer homes.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nWhether you want to\\xa0downsize your living expenses\\xa0to reach financial freedom sooner by moving into a tiny home, turbo boost your investment capital by buying tiny homes for cash, or getting lower mortgages for multiple properties, the numbers don’t lie: Tiny homes are moneymakers.\\xa0\\nAppreciation is often the big question leveled at tiny homes.\\xa0Clearly,\\xa0mobile tiny homes probably depreciate rather than appreciate and do not carry the same tax advantages as tiny homes\\xa0that\\xa0are\\xa0built\\xa0on a foundation on separate parcels of land. For the latter, as with larger homes, the same holds\\xa0true\\xa0for\\xa0tiny\\xa0homes. The more valuable the land and the greater the number of improvements you have made on your\\xa0tiny\\xa0home, the greater the appreciation will likely be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Investors Are Putting Their Money in Build-to-Rent Homes at a Record Rate—What’s Causing the Frenzy?', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nA record-high 27,500 build-to-rent homes were completed in 2023, almost triple the number of completions from two years prior. This year, the number of completions is set to nearly double.Institutional investors have poured large chunks of cash into build-to-rent homes. Blackstone, for example, has invested $9.5 billion into development.Most major metros are seeing record-high completions, but development is especially pronounced in Florida, Texas, and Arizona. \\n\\nInvestors are building single-family rental properties at an unprecedented rate, catering to a growing segment of renters seeking more space without the commitment of buying a home or the budget constraints of a high mortgage payment. A record-high 27,500 build-to-rent homes were completed in 2023, almost triple the number of completions from two years prior, according to an analysis of Yardi Matrix data from\\xa0RentCafe.\\nStarter homes are in short supply. In many areas of the country, entry-level homes listed below the area median home price are scarce. Even where these smaller, no-frills homes are on the market, they might not be affordable to the typical family due to a combination of stubbornly high home prices and high mortgage rates.\\xa0\\nFirst-time homebuyers have\\xa0come up with\\xa0several solutions to the\\xa0affordability\\xa0crisis, including\\xa0co-buying homes with their friends\\xa0and\\xa0living with their parents\\xa0to save for a down payment. Some are also settling for less square footage and shared walls, which has led to a boom in new\\xa0construction of\\xa0townhomes\\xa0or using the\\xa0house hacking\\xa0investment strategy to offset mortgage costs.\\xa0\\nBut for other millennials, finding a single-family home with plenty of bedrooms and a backyard in a neighborhood with good schools is still a top priority—even if it means they\\xa0have to\\xa0rent there. And some\\xa0remote workers\\xa0who prefer the amenities of a single-family home are choosing to rent for the freedom it provides. Therefore, demand for single-family rental homes has drawn interest from institutional investors and fueled a massive increase in the construction of homes intended for rent.\\xa0\\nMore Rental Homes on the Way\\nBuild-to-rent housing completions have rapidly increased since 2020, when only about 7,700 single-family rental homes\\xa0were completed. The trend will continue over the next couple of years, as more than\\xa045,400 rental properties\\xa0are currently under construction, most of which will be available for rent in 2025.\\xa0RentCafe anticipates moderation in new rental property construction in the coming years, however.\\xa0\\nIn some cases, investors build single-family rental homes within communities\\xa0that have\\xa0a mix of renters and owners. But there’s also been a rise in the construction of single-family rental communities.\\xa0These planned\\xa0build-to-rent communities\\xa0are neighborhoods of single-family homes, sometimes including\\xa0multifamily\\xa0units as well, all\\xa0of\\xa0which\\xa0share a common property manager and may feature community amenities such as outdoor spaces and fitness centers.\\xa0\\nBuild-to-rent housing draws interest from renters who\\xa0not only\\xa0want more space, but also\\xa0the newest home features. About 41% of the country’s build-to-rent houses were constructed within the last five years. A build-to-rent neighborhood holds similar appeal to a newly constructed for-sale development\\xa0while\\xa0often requiring a lower housing payment and allowing renters the freedom to move on without the hassle of selling.\\xa0\\nInvestors and developers have noticed the growing demand for these communities, and institutional investment in the asset class\\xa0is poised\\xa0for growth, according to a report from\\xa0Cushman and Wakefield.\\xa0For example, over the last few years, Blackstone has poured\\xa0over $9.5 billion\\xa0cash into single-family rental property investment.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMetro Areas with the Most Build-to-Rent Activity\\nIn\\xa014 of the top 20 major metro areas for build-to-rent housing, the number of completed units reached a 10-year peak.\\xa0\\nIn 2023, Phoenix stood out as a hotbed for build-to-rent activity, with more than 4,000 units completed. That’s a 164% year-over-year increase in newly built rental properties.\\xa0The\\xa0city has a growing population and plenty of land for expansion, according to\\xa0RentCafe.\\xa0In some\\xa0high-demand coastal cities, limited space for development has prevented the build-to-rent movement from taking hold.\\xa0\\nIn Dallas, almost 2,700 rental homes\\xa0were finished\\xa0in 2023, and Atlanta followed behind with\\xa0almost\\xa02,000 build-to-rent completions. Those three cities also saw the highest numbers of build-to-rent housing completed over the last five years, with a rapidly increasing availability of single-family rental properties\\xa0when\\xa0compared to 2018.\\xa0For example,\\xa0there were\\xa0only about 500 build-to-rent units available in Atlanta as of 2018.\\xa0By 2023, that number increased to over 4,000.\\xa0\\nThe top five states for completed build-to-rent homes in 2023 were all in the Sunbelt:\\n\\nTexas:\\xa04,800 units\\nArizona:\\xa04,000 units\\nFlorida:\\xa02,800 units\\nGeorgia:\\xa02,181 units\\nSouth Carolina:\\xa01,909 units\\n\\nIn Texas, build-to-rent housing is\\xa0particularly popular, and new construction in cities like Dallas, Houston, and Austin will only increase the already significant supply in the coming years.\\xa0And in\\xa0Florida, new build-to-rent construction is booming across\\xa0a few different\\xa0metros.\\nRentCafe also identified the other top markets with the most build-to-rent construction in progress.

      "{'title': 'The Best Appliances to Boost Your Rental Property’s Value—and Bonus Tips For Saving Money', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRental properties come in all shapes, sizes, and prices, as do many of the appliances that go in them. Assuming, however, that your rental is not a sprawling Beverly Hills mansion, a luxury condo in Manhattan, or, conversely, a trailer in Ohio, but rather a quality middle-class home or apartment of around 1,000 square feet in a decent neighborhood, choosing the right appliance for the home can be confusing.\\xa0\\nHere are some things to bear in mind.\\nCost\\nThe appliances in your investment property should suit the rental price. You\\xa0are not going to\\xa0put a $100,000 La Cornue range in a $1,500-per-month rental apartment. The key to choosing the right appliance for any rental is to find one that looks stylish and works well without spending a fortune. All tenants want to see modern stainless steel (or some version of such) appliances in their homes, which means staying away from\\xa0basic\\xa0white or black appliances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign Your Kitchen Around Your Range\\nThe good news is that dozens of cost-efficient appliances fit these criteria. Expect to spend anywhere from $800 to $1,300 for a solid, good-looking range.\\xa0Multiple companies\\xa0offer these types of standard 30-inch ranges that fit these criteria. GE, Frigidaire, and Whirlpool are among the most popular for rentals.\\xa0\\nThe\\xa0New York\\xa0Times‘\\xa0Wirecutter is a good, impartial place to\\xa0start researching\\xa0appliances. Although they have links to retailers and receive commissions from sales, the writers themselves—to quote the\\xa0Times—”are never made aware of any business relationships with retailers, and products\\xa0are recommended\\xa0(or not) independent of all business and financial interests.”\\xa0\\nHaving written a blog for an appliance retailer in the past, I cannot say that is true for other reviews on the web. I still fondly remember the free meals in a luxury appliance manufacturer’s plush Manhattan showroom—not to mention the closet full of free promo materials!\\nAs your range is the centerpiece of your kitchen, around which the main action occurs, I’ve always found it best to choose my other appliances around it. It’s also cost-effective and easy, and online stores offer appliance packages once you have\\xa0chosen\\xa0one item at deep discounts compared to buying each item individually.\\nCooktop or range?\\nGenerally speaking, ranges (also called stoves) are cheaper than cooktops, which sit on top of the counter and usually need slabs to\\xa0be cut\\xa0to accommodate them. Slide-in ranges are convenient, cost-effective, and easy to clean, service, and replace for rentals.\\xa0\\nGas or electric?\\nUnless you’re renting to Gordon Ramsay (in which case, congratulations, you’re rich!), having a naked flame in a rental unit is not a good idea. Electric ranges are easy to clean, present far less fire hazard, and are usually reasonably priced. Electric ranges are also better for the environment.\\nIt’s also worth noting that the world is trying to move away from fossil fuels, and\\xa0some American cities have outlawed gas ranges entirely. Regardless of where you stand politically on the issue, the tide of change is undeniable. In 10 years, electric cars will be the norm, as will fully electric homes (unless you own a wood-heated log cabin). It’s best to save yourself the hassle of buying new appliances and\\xa0get with\\xa0the electric program now.\\nInduction or not?\\nWhen I\\xa0first\\xa0started putting induction ranges in my rental units a few years back, contractors and other investors looked at me as if I had antennae sprouting from my head.\\xa0\\nInduction cooktops and ranges look and function like typical glass-top electric models, except they cook via a magnetic field. On most 30-inch induction cooktops, the field\\xa0is concentrated\\xa0into four spots (or elements).\\xa0This\\xa0means they do not emit heat like conventional electric cooktops but rather cook through a magnetic field when a pot or pan with a compliant circular pattern on the bottom (most have them)\\xa0is placed\\xa0on top.\\nIt’s\\xa0not as complicated as\\xa0it sounds.\\xa0They\\xa0cook like with an electric cooktop—just without any heat (you can put your bare hand on an element when it is turned on and not feel a thing). However, in a country often resistant to change, they have\\xa0not taken off in the U.S.\\xa0to the same extent as they have in Europe, where their use is widespread.\\xa0\\nThere are obvious advantages:\\n\\nSafety:\\xa0No risk of fire or burning.\\xa0This\\xa0could result in reduced insurance premiums.\\nEnergy efficiency:\\xa0Induction cooking is\\xa010% more energy efficient\\xa0than conventional electric cooking.\\nFast:\\xa0Waiting for a pan to heat up is not an issue, as the moment a compliant pan\\xa0is placed\\xa0on top, it cooks the food.\\nEasy cleanup:\\xa0There is no danger of food getting burned on the top of the cooktop because it never gets hot.\\nPeace of mind:\\xa0Landlords have one less thing to worry about since a stove fire will not happen in their rental unit.\\nMake venting easier:\\xa0Since naked flames are not a risk in your kitchen, there is no need for an industrial-sized vent that looks like it belongs in a commercial kitchen.\\xa0\\nYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the negative side, induction ranges are generally more expensive than conventional electric models (expect to\\xa0pay around $1,300\\xa0for a standard model that would suit mid-priced rentals). Also, some tenants might find using them takes some getting used to, and if you\\xa0are switching\\xa0from gas, rewiring your kitchen could be costly.\\nWith Refrigerators, Beware of Ice Dispensers\\nChoosing an applicable refrigerator\\xa0usually\\xa0comes down to kitchen space. Measure\\xa0before you buy.\\nHowever, steer clear of fridge freezers with exterior ice dispensers. While these might suit a personal residence, I never use them in rentals. Tenants are not meticulous about how much ice they dispense or the cleanup when some of it lands on the floor. Despite your waterproof tile or vinyl plank flooring, excess water on the floor is never a good idea. Also, they can be prone to leaks and malfunctions and be challenging to repair.\\nWasher-Dryers\\nAs the world moves away from gas, your choice of dryer to accompany your washer will be limited to electric. Like stoves, many people swear against electric drying, but if\\xa0you have a choice of bringing gas lines into the house and the inherent risk they pose, along with the opportunity to future-proof your rental business, electric dryers make sense.\\nRegarding the brand or size, stackable or side-by-side, there are hundreds of choices, and yours should\\xa0be based\\xa0on budget, size of the rental, and number of tenants.\\xa0I\\xa0won’t\\xa0get into the minutiae of\\xa0all\\xa0the configurations.\\xa0However, I will offer a few broader brush strokes of advice.\\xa0\\nStay away from all-in-one washers and dryers.\\xa0They\\xa0are just\\xa0not\\xa0that\\xa0efficient\\xa0yet, particularly when it comes to drying.\\xa0 As a last resort, if you are space-challenged, you might be forced to buy one. Frankly, though, a clothes rack would prove a less frustrating experience.\\nShort-Term Rentals\\nIf you have\\xa0short-term rentals,\\xa0as I do,\\xa0my advice is\\xa0to\\xa0opt for a commercial-grade washer and dryer.\\xa0They might not look as fancy as residential-use ones, but with a high volume of laundry and guests who are not concerned about the upkeep of your appliances, a commercial-grade combo is the way to go.\\xa0\\nSpeed Queen\\xa0has had this market locked down for decades. They are durable workhorses with\\xa0great\\xa0warranties.\\xa0\\nFrigidaire and Whirlpool\\nFrom my experience in the appliance business, two brands dominated the mid-range rental and flip business: Frigidaire and Whirlpool, for\\xa0the reasons I stated earlier—they look good, work well, and are reasonably priced. While higher-end brands such as Miele, Bosch, and Thermador come with a certain amount of glamour and prestige, unless you have luxury rentals, it’s not worth spending the money on luxury appliances.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFinal Thoughts\\nAppliances are often their last thought when outfitting a rental for many landlords. For tenants, appliances are often their first thought. That’s why many landlords opt to buy used appliances. Used appliances can save money in the short term but prevent you from charging higher rents and not having warranties for new appliances.\\xa0\\nOther things to bear in mind:\\n\\nCost segregation:\\xa0Under\\xa0tax law section 179, landlords may deduct the cost of appliances on their taxes.\\nInclude the upkeep of new appliances in your leases:\\xa0Your\\xa0rental lease\\xa0should have a clause that lists all included appliances and stipulates any special maintenance requirements or responsibilities.\\xa0This\\xa0will hold tenants accountable for their upkeep.\\nEnergy rating:\\xa0Many tenants move because of high utility bills. Low costs through energy-efficient appliances are\\xa0good\\xa0for your bottom line and the planet.\\nAppliance warranties:\\xa0Choose appliances with excellent repair\\xa0warranties. You can often negotiate an extended warranty with the retailer, particularly if you have multiple rentals and offer them ongoing business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind the Right Agent, Find the Right Property\\nStep #1: Use Agent Finder to match with top investor-friendly real estate agents to help you find, analyze, and close your next deal.\\n\\nFind an Agent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Detroit Beat Its Post-Pandemic Downtown Doom Loop—Here’s How Investors Can Benefit', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\xa0mayor in handcuffs, a\\xa0bankrupt city\\xa0mired in poverty, unemployment, and soaring crime: 10 years ago that was Detroit’s legacy. Today, it is a real estate success story.\\xa0\\nEarly investors—to quote one of Motown’s most famous songs—are dancing in the street. Developers are pouring billions of dollars into its business district, luring the likes of Ford, Quicken Loans, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and more to take up office space. There’s even a\\xa0Gucci\\xa0store—the city’s first. The spillover has resulted in booming residential home prices—up 40% since 2020—and revitalized neighborhoods.\\nVacant Buildings to Residential Space\\nDetroit’s tale is one that other cities such as Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco, experiencing the post-pandemic\\xa0downtown doom loop\\xa0of empty offices and increased vagrancy, could do well to emulate. A total of\\xa040-plus major construction projects\\xa0have been completed or are being completed downtown since 2018, and thanks to new construction and repurposed former vacant buildings, there will be\\xa09,567\\xa0more residential units in 2024 than in 2021.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreserving and Repurposing Historic Buildings\\nIn this respect, Detroit has succeeded where other cities have failed,\\xa0in part\\xa0because many of the city’s downtown office buildings are almost a century old, with small floors and stylish architecture that convert well into residential buildings—unlike the 1970s and ’80s glassy towers in other cities.\\xa0\\nSpearheading this conversion is Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native and the billionaire co-founder of home lender Rocket Mortgage. This pioneer moved his company to downtown from the suburbs in 2010. He told the\\xa0Wall Street Journal, “We\\xa0really\\xa0had three options: Extend the leases, go to some farmland and build a campus—which wasn’t\\xa0really\\xa0attractive to us—or come downtown and fill up some of these beautiful old buildings that we\\xa0really\\xa0loved.”\\nMaking Downtown a Destination for More Than Work\\nGilbert’s companies bought\\xa0more than\\xa0130 properties downtown, spending billions on revitalizing the city and encouraging other companies to take advantage of cheap office space in gorgeous buildings. Ford Motor Company, always synonymous with the city, is spending $900 million to redevelop Michigan Central, the city’s abandoned train station—opening in June—and surrounding properties. Start-ups are streaming in.\\xa0\\nHowever, to make Downtown less office-dependent, casinos, sports venues, and revamped aging theaters have added a vibrant nightlife appeal. Developers have responded to generous tax breaks to build, and the knock-on effect has been increased condo and apartment prices.\\n“Best Investment in America”\\nResidential property values in the city climbed an average of\\xa023% last year, marking the seventh straight year of growth. Values rose 31% in 2022 and 8% per neighborhood from 2021 numbers. In total, all 208 of the city’s neighborhoods saw increases.\\nMayor Mike Duggan gleefully called the city the “best investment in America.” Some neighborhoods, such as Campau/Banglatown, New Center Commons, DelRay, and Carbon Works,\\xa0saw their values increase\\xa0by more than 50%. A strategic plan to keep\\xa0real estate taxes\\xa0low has helped.\\n“Since 2018, Detroit property values have exploded, not your tax rate,” Duggan said in a statement. “It stayed down here, and today, the average Detroiter is\\xa0being taxed\\xa0at half their assessed value.”\\nA Haven for House Flippers\\nAs such, in recent years, Detroit has been a haven for\\xa0house flippers\\xa0and new residents. Duggan said about 15,000 homes, as well as parks, streetscapes, and streetlights, saw improvements. He also mentioned the Detroit Land Bank’s declining inventory, which has gone from 45,000 abandoned homes in 2014 to less than 5,000 today.\\nToday, Detroit remains\\xa0extremely\\xa0affordable.\\xa0According to\\xa0Realtor.com,\\xa0the median listing home price is $89,900, and the median sold home price is $79,000.\\xa0Although the current 4,236 homes for sale cover a wide range of prices—everywhere from $750 for a lot to $8.6 million for a 36,000-square-foot\\xa0multifamily\\xa0property—investing and raising a family in a decent Detroit neighborhood is\\xa0extremely\\xa0achievable.\\nRents have also increased in the city, making it\\xa0a\\xa0profitable\\xa0place\\xa0for out-of-town landlords to invest.\\xa0They often\\xa0buy houses for cash. The\\xa0same amount of money would only pay for a\\xa0down payment\\xa0elsewhere.\\xa0\\n“Market sales are 58%, and distress[ed] sales are about 42%,” City Councilman Coleman A. Young II told the\\xa0Detroit News. “That’s one of the first times that we’ve had more market sales than distress[ed] sales in\\xa0the city of\\xa0Detroit.” In 2013, 90% of Detroit’s homes were sold for cash, as borrowers could not obtain a mortgage.\\xa0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut There Are Still Issues\\nDespite the massive new development and rising house prices, investing in a Detroit fixer-upper is far from a cakewalk, as this\\xa0New York Times article\\xa0reveals.\\xa0Finding a quality, honest contractor\\xa0can still be\\xa0tough, and\\xa0nefarious\\xa0characters are around, ready to steal tools and worse. “Welcome to Detroit” is a phrase often used by jaded police officers when out-of-state investors fall victim to crime.\\xa0\\nAll this means that out-of-town investors still have to pick and choose neighborhoods to buy in carefully, and having the help of\\xa0knowledgeable real estate investors\\xa0and property managers in the area is a huge benefit.\\xa0\\nOther Cities Like Detroit Where Investment Makes Sense\\nIt’s hard to find cities like Detroit, where house prices\\xa0are\\xa0still\\xa0incredibly low,\\xa0and\\xa0yet tremendous development and appreciation have occurred.\\xa0That’s because Detroit scratched its way up from bankruptcy when the loose change in your pocket could have bought you a home there a decade ago.\\xa0\\nOther\\xa0major\\xa0cities experiencing downtown problems\\xa0are\\xa0still\\xa0too\\xa0expensive to invest in, whereas other\\xa0affordable Midwestern cities, such as Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Cleveland, have been\\xa0losing workers\\xa0in their downtowns, resulting in a loss of residents.\\xa0\\nHowever,\\xa0several Midwestern cities, such as Canton and Akron, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; and Springfield, Missouri, have emulated Detroit, reinventing themselves with new businesses and attracting new residents. These cities are ripe for investment.\\xa0Beginning the investment journey here means comparing house\\xa0prices,\\xa0rental\\xa0rates,\\xa0and talking to real estate agents and property managers.\\nFinal Thoughts\\xa0\\nAs an experienced investor, I have learned that the bodybuilding adage of “no pain, no gain” also holds\\xa0true\\xa0for real estate. To achieve the best returns, you have to\\xa0be prepared\\xa0to endure a degree of discomfort.\\xa0Riding\\xa0an equity/appreciation wave as a city transitions from bad times to\\xa0good\\xa0means catching the wave during the dark days and all the ills that come with it.\\nEarly pioneers who invested in Detroit 15 years ago undoubtedly have their war stories but are sitting pretty today. However, the house prices are still low enough that investing here\\xa0still\\xa0makes sense.\\nLooking at the projects planned for a city’s downtown area can often indicate how the surrounding areas will operate: What new businesses are moving in? Are they future-proof? What are the development plans? Are there new coffee shops, art galleries, and artists in the neighborhoods? Are residents arriving rather than leaving?\\xa0\\nThese are the early signs of any city on the move. Making a downtown livable and a place to congregate safely outside work hours is another\\xa0strong\\xa0sign.\\xa0So far, Detroit\\xa0seems to have\\xa0checked all the boxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Should You Invest for Cash Flow or Appreciation? Let’s Reevaluate in an Era of High Interest Rates', 'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor real estate investors, the question of cash flow versus appreciation is as old as time.\\xa0However, in an\\xa0era of\\xa0high interest\\xa0rates, buying properties for cash flow\\xa0isn’t easy.\\xa0That doesn’t mean investing should be off the table, as there are many advantages of owning rentals other than immediate cash flow—appreciation and tax advantages being the most obvious.\\xa0\\nWhether to keep buying or stay\\xa0on the sidelines comes down to some specific decisions.\\xa0Let’s dig deeper.\\nThe Higher the Cash Flow, the Greater the Headaches\\nThe less expensive the property, the greater the cash flow. That’s the theory, anyway. Rentals in low-income neighborhoods might cost less, but tenants also earn less and cannot withstand the financial hurdles that life throws\\xa0at\\xa0them. Thus, potential cash flow numbers\\xa0are rarely achieved\\xa0due to vacancies, repairs, and evictions.\\xa0\\nBuying multiple doors in C or D+ neighborhoods has the potential to turn into one big headache.\\xa0This\\xa0was exposed during the pandemic when most tenants seeking a pause in rental payments and an\\xa0eviction moratorium\\xa0were from\\xa0lower-income areas. The landlords greatest affected were smaller mom-and-pop owners who fell behind on mortgage payments, ruing the day they chose to invest where they did.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Section 8 Caveat\\nSome might champion Section 8 rentals, but the hurdles of dealing with Section 8 inspectors and hoping your tenants maintain your property often make the experience hard for investors who got into real estate to lessen life’s stresses rather than add to them.\\xa0\\nHowever, with interest rates higher than\\xa0they have been\\xa0in years, the only places to cash flow are likely cheaper properties in lower-income neighborhoods.\\xa0Many successful landlords are in these areas, but it is\\xa0not\\xa0a\\xa0passive\\xa0venture.\\xa0Stabilizing buildings and maintaining repairs and rents is a full-time, labor-intensive endeavor.\\nParking Your Cash for Appreciation and Tax Benefits\\nNot needing cash flow is the enviable position many investors want to get to because it means you are already financially free. According to CoreLogic’s U.S. Home Price Insights, nationwide,\\xa0prices increased by 5.5%\\xa0year over year as of December 2023.\\xa0This\\xa0coincides with a healthy job market, wage growth, and lowered inflation.\\nUsing a 5% metric, if you own an investment property valued at $200,000, your home would have appreciated\\xa0by\\xa0around $10,000 in one year. That’s the equivalent of cash flowing just under $1,000/month. In the current interest rate climate, that’s a tough ask.\\nIf you own $2 million worth of real estate, you would have increased your net worth by $100,000. Added to this are the\\xa0tax benefits\\xa0of\\xa0depreciation, repair, and operating expenses associated with real estate, which means even if you are not cash-flowing, you are still building wealth.\\xa0Refinancing\\xa0will add cash flow to the equation when rates eventually drop.\\xa0\\nBetter Neighborhoods Equals Lower Cash Flow\\nThe problem with investing in highly appreciating areas is that they generally\\xa0do not\\xa0cash flow\\xa0well\\xa0because they are more expensive.\\xa0However, when factored against tenant issues in lower-income neighborhoods, holding on to a good asset in a more upscale neighborhood is likely\\xa0to be\\xa0more beneficial in appreciation, even if it only pays for itself. The cash flow will also increase once the asset\\xa0is paid down\\xa0and the rents\\xa0increase.\\nThe Case for Cash Flow\\nMany\\xa0syndicators\\xa0utilize the strategy of forcing appreciation through value-added improvements that increase cash flow to attract investors who would otherwise be unwilling to invest.\\n“We never invest for\\xa0appreciation,\\xa0since that is out of our control,” Tyler Cauble of\\xa0The Cauble Group, a commercial real estate investor and consultant, told\\xa0bestevercre.com. “Our team selects projects where we can create value and force appreciation through value-add or development from scratch. Any appreciation is just icing on top.”\\nJonathan Barr of\\xa0JB2 Investments, a multifamily syndicator, concurred: “I would say: Always invest for cash flow—but inevitably, increased positive cash flow\\xa0is followed\\xa0by appreciation.”\\nGrant Cardone is one of the most voluble proponents of the cash flow model. On\\xa0gctv.com, he poses the cash flow versus appreciation question—and answers it this way:\\n“Whenever someone asks me if cash flow or appreciation is better when investing in real estate, I\\xa0give them a dumbfounded look\\xa0because they should already know the answer.\\xa0Cash flow investments provide a regular stream of income. In contrast, appreciation investments offer the potential for a more significant return if the investment is sold at a higher price than the purchase price. Getting wealthy from real estate investments is possible. You\\xa0have to\\xa0focus on cash flow, and the market fluctuation won’t affect you as much.”You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War—but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback—Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season—How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs It Possible to Cash Flow Without Giving Your Money to a Syndicator?\\nDespite what most syndicator salespeople might claim, handing your cash over to them should require first knowing the details of their financing. Without this knowledge, you are taking a leap of faith. In an era of fluctuating interest rates, only long-term financing attained before the rise in rates can insulate an operator against financial difficulties.\\xa0\\nIf you want to maintain autonomy and cash flow on your investment properties, here are some steps to take:\\n\\nBuy under-market properties that need work, complete the work, and increase rents.\\nMake a\\xa0large\\xa0down payment\\xa0to ensure the home cash flows, and refinance once rates drop.\\nAdd bedrooms by converting attics and larger rooms to increase cash flow.\\nRent by the room to add rental income.\\nUse your property as a\\xa0short-term rental, if possible.\\xa0According to AirDNA, STRs generate\\xa061% more income\\xa0than regular rentals. The STR market\\xa0continues to grow\\xa0despite higher interest rates, as lower inflation has increased travel, AirDNA says.\\nSecure noninstitutional financing from a family member at a lower rate.\\nEnter into a\\xa0subject-to-agreement\\xa0with the current owner, keep the current mortgage in place, and refinance them out of the property when rates drop.\\nLiquidate other assets to buy the home for cash at a discounted price and refinance when rates drop.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nInterest rates are the differentiator in the cash flow versus appreciation argument. Although many syndicators and gurus might preach that “cash flow is king,” with rates unlikely to drop substantially in a robust economy, a more nuanced approach could be beneficial—if you can afford it.\\xa0\\nIf you are not in a rush to quit your job and can afford to ride out high rates, buying for appreciation and tax advantages while waiting for a refinance to cash flow later could be wise. There’s little doubt that prices will soar as rates drop.\\xa0\\nHowever, if you don’t have cash reserves and must find a cash-flowing investment, you’ll need to make a risk-versus-reward decision. Hitching your financial wagon to a syndicator without the requisite research is\\xa0a risk. Implementing some of the strategies mentioned here could work. Also, waiting until you are in a better financial position to invest could be prudent.\\nAs an experienced investor who enjoys their job (I write for BiggerPockets!), I have taken the somewhat uncomfortable move of stocking up on real estate in solid B/B+ neighborhoods, leveraging myself\\xa0in a way\\xa0that I wouldn’t necessarily advise others, taking the tax breaks over cash flow, and waiting for rates to fall. It’s a long-term approach that I have watched other investors successfully employ. It’s not for everyone, but having endured wipeouts\\xa0previously, I’ve come to appreciate the value of holding solid assets in good areas. Cash flow is\\xa0wonderful, but to expect it overnight is, I’ve discovered, often wishful thinking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet the Best Loan Today\\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \\n\\n\\nFind a Lender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin the community\\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

      "{'title': 'Most affordable neighborhoods in the US', 'content': \"Categories\\n\\nReal Estate \\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 28, 2023 \\n by Mark Ferguson\\n\\n\\nShould you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\\nWith interest rates rising over the last year, it has made it tougher and tougher for real estate investors and owner-occupied home buyers. People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don’t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \\nHave high rates caused property values to decline?\\nThere are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \\nWe have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \\n\\nHigh rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \\n\\n\\n\\nShould you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\\nI think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \\nHere are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\\n\\nDoes the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn’t mean that properties can’t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \\nWhat kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \\nCan you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \\nDo you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don’t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn’t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \\nAre you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \\n\\nWill rates go down allowing a refinance?\\nI believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \\nNo one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \\nConclusion\\nIf you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare this post: \\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whatsapp\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Telegram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Twitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Email\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t2 thoughts on “Should you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?”\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PS Group says: \\n\\nOctober 25, 2023 at 1:21 am \\n\\n\\nVery useful advice!

      "{'title': 'Most popular homes and their neighborhoods of July 2019', 'content': \"Categories\\n\\nReal Estate \\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 28, 2023 \\n by Mark Ferguson\\n\\n\\nShould you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\\nWith interest rates rising over the last year, it has made it tougher and tougher for real estate investors and owner-occupied home buyers. People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don’t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \\nHave high rates caused property values to decline?\\nThere are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \\nWe have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \\n\\nHigh rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \\n\\n\\n\\nShould you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\\nI think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \\nHere are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\\n\\nDoes the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn’t mean that properties can’t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \\nWhat kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \\nCan you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \\nDo you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don’t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn’t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \\nAre you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \\n\\nWill rates go down allowing a refinance?\\nI believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \\nNo one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \\nConclusion\\nIf you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare this post: \\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whatsapp\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Telegram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Twitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Email\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t2 thoughts on “Should you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?”\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PS Group says: \\n\\nOctober 25, 2023 at 1:21 am \\n\\n\\nVery useful advice!

      "Have you thought about becoming a property manager, but want to know what the property manager role actually entails? What are the responsibilities of a property manager?\n",
      "Read on if you are contemplating pursuing a property management career. We hope the list of responsibilities below will help you decide if this career is for you.\n",
      "What Does a Property Manager Do?\n",
      "In general, a property manager is hired when the landlord or real estate investor wants to outsource some or all of the daily responsibilities of their rental property. Property manager responsibilities can, indeed, include a few basic tasks or you might be responsible for entire operations at the property. We list below 10 common property manager responsibilities.\n",
      "1. Finding New Tenants\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities usually include tenant management. This is the main responsibility of landlords and many are happy to outsource this to property managers. Tenant management often includes finding and attracting tenants. Residential property managers are expected to fill vacant rental units at the property. Marketing a rental property, therefore, is part of the job description. They will need to advertise the rentals and post compelling ads to relevant listing sites and other places for advertising rentals.\n",
      "2. Tenant Screening\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities also include making sure that new prospective tenants are trustworthy. Here, professional property managers often have a specific tenant screening process that goes through the prospective tenants’ credit history and backgrounds. The good thing here is that the more people they screen over time, the better and faster they can pick the right tenants and avoid frequent tenant turnover.\n",
      "3. Handling Complaints\n",
      "Maintenance and handling complaints are also common property management responsibilities. For example, if someone is having frequent parties at the property and the neighbors complain about it, it will likely be the property manager who will have to deal with it. Sometimes property managers even have to handle emergency situations, so you should also be aware of the safety precautions taken at the property.\n",
      "4. Coordinating Tenant Turnover\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities include the coordination of tenant turnover. Indeed, property managers are the ones who need to coordinate when people move in and out. Property managers will need to check the rental spaces after previous tenants for damages, organize cleaning, and fix any damages before new tenants move in.\n",
      "In some cases where tenants cause problems, the property manager handles the evictions. This means they should know the landlord-tenant laws as well as have the courage to handle the situation confidently.\n",
      "5. Setting, Collecting, and Adjusting Rents\n",
      "Collecting rent is a basic responsibility of any landlord. Property manager responsibilities, therefore, can also include lease management as this task landlords gladly outsource to property managers. The property manager will also usually define and set up systems for collecting rent from tenants. They will often have to include strict deadlines and penalties for late payments, and a method to check all rents have been paid as agreed.\n",
      "The property manager is not only in charge of collecting the rents but is also usually responsible for setting a rental rate. This requires that they actually know the market. A property manager must adjust the rents in a way that attracts tenants but also generates rental income for the owners. Likewise, the property manager can also increase or lower rent annually based on the developments in the real estate market.\n",
      "6. Property Maintenance\n",
      "\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities also include property maintenance. This will ensure the property stays in good condition and is a safe environment for the tenants. Maintenance means investigating and resolving tenant complaints and enforcing rules of occupancy. They will also check all the vacant apartments and maintain and renovate them as needed or coordinate the work of contractors. Do note that in colder locations, basic maintenance can even include contracting snow removal services.\n",
      "7. Securing the Property\n",
      "Property manager responsibilities often go beyond basic maintenance at the rental property. They will also need to secure the property by either contracting security guards or maintaining proper security devices or both. Their role will also include setting up policies and procedures that build emergency preparedness. A professional property manager knows that the more secure the rental property is, the more sense of security the tenants feel. This improves tenant retention.\n",
      "8. Overall Supervision \n",
      "The responsibilities of a property manager and their role can often be a lot more than meets the eye. Yes, property manager responsibilities do include the more visible day-to-day errands and services, but in the background, they can, in fact, run the entire show. That is if the real estate investor wants to utilize the whole spectrum of property management support available out there. Property managers can be requested to carry out all the analysis, planning, and management of the property. To this end, they do need a wide set of management skills and knowledge of the real estate domain.\n",
      "If there are other employees working in the rental property, for example, security guards, property manager duties include supervising their work. This includes setting their salaries and evaluating their performance. Property managers will also supervise other potential contractors at the property.\n",
      "9. Financial Management\n",
      "For a residential property manager, financial management starts from analyzing and establishing the right rental rates, calculating costs, depreciation, and taxes as well as determining realistic profit goals and a budget to achieve them. On top of planning, a property manager is also expected to accomplish financial objectives. To this end, they collect rents and pay invoices, monitor variances, and take corrective action to get the budget back on track.\n",
      "10. Staying Up-to-Date and Enforcing Landlord-Tenant Laws\n",
      "Professional property managers must have in-depth knowledge of local landlord-tenant laws in terms of screening tenants, handling security deposits, lease terminations, and evictions, as well as compliance with property safety standards. They will have to enforce these and all the policies laid out in the lease contracts. This can also include confronting potential violators.\n",
      "Final Thoughts\n",
      "We hope this list of common property manager responsibilities provided you a better understanding of what is expected of this role. As you probably noticed, property manager responsibilities can include only a few essential tasks or include entire management of the rental property. It is safe to say that property managers need to acquire various skills and knowledge for managing rental properties successfully.

      "Should you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\n",
      "With interest rates rising over the last year, it has made it tougher and tougher for real estate investors and owner-occupied home buyers. People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don’t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \n",
      "Have high rates caused property values to decline?\n",
      "There are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \n",
      "We have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \n",
      "\n",
      "High rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\n",
      "I think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \n",
      "Here are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn’t mean that properties can’t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \n",
      "What kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \n",
      "Can you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \n",
      "Do you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don’t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn’t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \n",
      "Are you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will rates go down allowing a refinance?\n",
      "I believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \n",
      "No one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "If you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \n",
