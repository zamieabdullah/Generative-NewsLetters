      "### Key Trends and Insights\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Median Listing Price:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **2017-2019 and 2020-2022 Trends**: There was a steady increase in median listing prices from around \\$275,000 in late 2017 to around \\$403,700 in early 2023. This reflects a strong upward trend in real estate prices over the years, likely due to factors such as increased demand, inflation, or decreased inventory.\n",
      "- **2023 Trends**: The prices peaked at around \\$445,000 in mid-2023 before showing a gradual decline toward the end of the year and into early 2024. This could indicate a cooling of the housing market or a response to corrective economic measures.\n",
      "- **Annual Growth Rate**: The year-over-year percentage changes show strong growth, peaking at a 16.2% rate in early 2022 and starting to diminish towards the end of the data set, indicating a surge followed by stabilization or slight decrease in growth pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Active Listing Count:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Trend Over Time**: There is a noticeable decline in active listings from around 1.29 million in Oct 2017 to about 403,700 in early 2023. This likely indicates tighter inventory in the housing market over the years.\n",
      "- **Seasonal Fluctuations**: Adjustments in listing counts follow a seasonal pattern, with notable decreases during the winter months (end of the year), highlighting the cyclic nature of the housing market.\n",
      "- **Recent Developments**: Rapid drops in listing counts around the beginning of 2021 suggest that increased demand or economic conditions significantly constrained supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Median Days on Market:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Decreasing Trend**: The median days on the market have generally decreased from about 68 days in Oct 2017 to around 47 days in early 2024. A lower median days on the market typically indicate quicker sales.\n",
      "- **Seasonal Variation**: There is a clear seasonal pattern where homes take longer to sell during the colder months (e.g., Dec-Jan) and fewer days in the warmer months (e.g., July).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### New Listing Count:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Inventory Dynamics**: There has been a significant decrease in the count of new listings year-over-year, especially starkly in late 2020 and early 2021. This could be due to hesitancy to list during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "- **Recent Trends**: The number of new listings shows signs of recovery in late 2022 and early 2023, suggesting a potential normalization or increased seller activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Price Increase and Reduction Counts:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Price Increases**: The price increase counts saw variability, with peaks around early 2022 and signs of stabilization/decline heading into 2023. This possibly indicates fluctuating seller confidence and market adjustment.\n",
      "- **Price Reductions**: After a period of declining price reductions, there has been an uptick going into late 2023, suggesting potential market corrections or responses to changing buyer dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pending Listing Count:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Demand Indication**: The pending listing counts saw dramatic increases, particularly during pandemic peaks (2020-present), highlighting increased buyer activity and transaction velocity.\n",
      "- **Recent Trends**: A slight dip post-pandemic peaks but still higher than pre-pandemic norms, implying sustained demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Median Listing Price Per Square Foot:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Consistent Increase**: From $134 per square foot in late 2017 to around $230 per square foot in early 2024, indicating rising property values, which coincide with the tracked increase in median listing prices.\n",
      "- **Recovery Post-COVID**: Noticeable spikes in price per square foot during the pandemic period, emphasizing shifts in housing preferences and possibly tighter urban/rural supply dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Listing Count:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Overall Decline**: The total listing count has declined consistently, aligning with the active listing count trends, indicating a contraction of market supply over the past several years.\n",
      "- **Market Correction**: Recent signals of slight upticks into 2023, which might suggest market adjustments or increased new listings in response to growing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Housing Market Activity Indicators:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pending Ratio**: High pending ratios in 2021 indicate a faster conversion of listings to pending sales, but there's a decreasing trend into 2023, pointing to possible market cooling or lesser buyer urgency.\n",
      "- **Cooling Effect**: The cooling of the real estate market is indicated by the reduction of median days on the market and pending ratios starting in late 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictions (Forecast for 2024):\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the trends and seasonal patterns observed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Median Listing Price**:\n",
      "   - Likely to stabilize further or show slower growth, potentially peaking around \\$430,000 to \\$450,000 by mid-2024 and staying within this range, assuming no abrupt economic changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Active Listing Count**:\n",
      "   - Possibly showing slight increases, ranging between 400,000 to 450,000 as the market attempts to balance out demand and supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Median Days on Market**:\n",
      "   - Expected to remain relatively low, within 45 to 60 days, reflecting a fairly active market but potentially slower than 2022/2023 peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **New Listings**:\n",
      "   - Likely to continue recovering, maintaining seasonal booms, potentially peaking above 400,000 new listings towards mid-2024 if economic and seller conditions stay favorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Price Increase and Reduction Dynamics**:\n",
      "   - Market stabilization might mean fewer excessive price increases and a steadier pace of price reductions, depending on buyer affordability and interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pending Listings**:\n",
      "   - May see marginal declines or stabilization within 550,000 to 600,000, reflecting sustained but moderate buyer activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Median Listing Price Per Square Foot**:\n",
      "   - Could observe slower growth, stabilizing between \\$230 to \\$240 per square foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Total Listing Count**:\n",
      "   - Expected to fluctuate seasonally but might stabilize around 1,150,000 to 1,200,000 listings by year-end, reflecting slight market recovery or balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "These forecasts assume consistent economic conditions with no major disruptions from economic policy changes, global events, or significant shifts in consumer behaviors.\n"
