      "  - The median days on market has decreased from 2017-2021, reaching a low of 30 days (Apr and May of 2022).\n",
      "  - Recently, the number of days on market has increased again, reaching 47 days in Apr 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insights:**\n",
      "  - The rapid decreases in days on market from 2017-2021 indicate a competitive buyer’s market.\n",
      "  - The increase in 2022 may suggest a shift towards a more balanced market.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **New Listing Count:**\n",
      "- **Trend:**\n",
      "  - New listings exhibit seasonal peaks, with more listings shown around Spring/Summer.\n",
      "  - The counts have increased in the past year, indicative of a recovering market post-pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insights:**\n",
      "  - The seasonal pattern should be factored into supply-demand assessments.\n",
      "  - The recent uptick in new listings hints at increased seller activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. **Price Increased Count:**\n",
      "- **Trend:**\n",
      "  - The number of listing price increases has remained moderately steady but saw significant increases in 2020/2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insights:**\n",
      "  - Persistent price increases align with strong market conditions.\n",
      "  - Tracking these counts is a good indicator of seller confidence.\n",

      "#### 6. **Price Reduced Count:**\n",
      "- **Trend:**\n",
      "  - The number has shown a declining trend until mid-2021 and then exhibited significant increases by 2022.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Insights:**\n",
      "  - A higher number of price reductions suggest sellers adjusting expectations after initial high listings.\n",
      "  - The recent increase could indicate cooling in the over-heated segments of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7. **Pending Listing Count:**\n",
      "- **Trend:**\n",
      "  - There is an overall increasing trend in pendings from 2017, with peaks correlating with housing activity seasons (Spring/Summer).\n",
      "  - The pending ratio follows similar patterns, indicating strong absorption rates in the market’s active inventory.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insights:**\n",
      "  - Increased pending counts suggest strong buying activity.\n",
      "  - High pending ratios (ranging over 1.0) suggest a very competitive market.\n",

      "- **Trend:**\n",
      "  - This metric reveals a significant increasing trend from $134/sqft (Oct 2017) to $230/sqft (Apr 2024).\n",

      "### Predictions (Next 1 Year: Apr 2024 - Apr 2025)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Median Listing Price:**\n",
      "- Continuing the past trend, it's reasonable to expect the median listing price to further increase from $429,950 to approximately $450,000 by Apr 2025 considering an annual growth rate of around 4 to 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Active Listing Count:**\n",
      "- Expect seasonal peaks and troughs, with Spring 2025 listings possibly reaching up to 850,000, and Winter 2024 counts likely dropping to below 700,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Median Days on Market:**\n",
      "- Assuming steady market demand, median days may stabilize around 45-50 days in off-season periods and potentially drop to near 40 days during high activity seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. **New Listing Count:**\n",
      "- Predict seasonal increases with a probable peak approaching 390,000 new listings by Spring 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. **Price Increased Count:**\n",
      "- Roughly estimate continual albeit moderate increases, with counts possibly hovering around 20,000 price increases monthly during high activity seasons, and lower counts in off-seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. **Price Reduced Count:**\n",
      "- With ongoing market stabilization, expect moderate decreases in where necessary, likely in the range of 150,000 to 170,000 throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7. **Pending Listing Count:**\n",
      "- Seasonal trends should persist, peaking in Spring/Summer, potentially approaching 500,000 pending listings by mid-2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 8. **Median Listing Price Per Square Foot:**\n",
      "- Expect continued appreciation, potentially reaching $240/sqft by Apr 2025.\n",
