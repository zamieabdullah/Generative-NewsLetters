      "### Key Trends and Insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Median Listing Price**:\n",
      "    - From October 2017 to October 2023, there has been a general upward trend in the median listing price with periodic corrections.\n",
      "    - Notable jumps occurred during 2022, reaching a peak of $450,000 in June 2022.\n",
      "    - Early 2023 has shown cooling down with prices around $429,950 in April 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Median Listing Price MoM (Month over Month) and YoY (Year over Year)**:\n",
      "    - MoM changes show some volatility but a consistent upward trend until late 2022.\n",
      "    - YoY changes peaked massively in early 2022 but have declined considerably by early 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Active Listing Count**:\n",
      "    - Thereâ€™s a significant decrease in the number of active listings from 2018 through 2021, reaching a low point in early 2022.\n",
      "    - 2023 saw a resurgence in active listings, suggesting more inventory becoming available in the market.\n",
      "    \n",
      "4. **Days on Market**:\n",
      "    - The median days on market have seen cyclical patterns. Significantly shorter days were observed during mid-year months post-2020. \n",
      "    - The trend points towards more balanced periods between longer market days and quicker listings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **New Listing Count**:\n",
      "    - The number of new listings has been volatile with considerable drops and recoveries evident, especially during the pandemic years (late 2019-2022).\n",
      "    - The data reveals potential seasonality, with peaks generally in late spring/early summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pending Listing Count**:\n",
      "    - A decline in pending listings after 2019 with a resurgence in 2022 onwards despite the volatility.\n",
      "    - The trend indicates possible market stabilization following the fluctuations during the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Price Change Metrics**:\n",
      "    - The number of price increases and reductions have broad fluctuations, showing many sellers are adjusting prices actively in response to market dynamics.\n",
      "    - Price decreases surged particularly in 2022, reflecting adjustments to high listing prices potentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Median Listing Price per Square Foot**:\n",
      "    - Continuous upward trend indicating rising property values, regardless of fluctuations in overall listing prices.\n",
      "    - Price per square foot has grown from $134 in late 2017 to $230 in April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Median Square Feet of Listings**:\n",
      "    - Relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating that the size of homes listed has not significantly changed over the period evaluated.\n",
      "  \n",
      "10. **Total Listing Count**:\n",
      "    - A dip throughout the early 2020s with increases in recent years, suggesting market movements resurging post-pandemic dips.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Pending Ratio**:\n",
      "    - Higher pending ratios recently suggest quicker absorption of markets compared to the more stable, lower ratios of earlier years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Predictions for the Next Year (up to December 2024):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Median Listing Price**:\n",
      "   - **Projected Increase** likely around 3-5% annually due to continued demand and inflationary pressures. \n",
      "   - **Estimated Price**: Close to $445,000-$450,000 by mid-2024 and $460,000 by the end of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Active Listing Count**:\n",
      "   - The trend suggests a probable stabilization or slight increase as markets balance. Expect around 1-1.1 million by mid-2024 and possibly stabilizing marginally higher as inventory increases.\n",
      "   - **Estimated Active Listings**: 1.2 million by end of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Median Days on Market**:\n",
      "   - Continued stabilization with median days expected to stay within the 45-60 day range as the market balances out.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **New Listings Count**:\n",
      "   - A potential increase in new listings as the market conditions improve could see new listings peaking again in spring/summer of 2024 reaching around 400,000-500,000 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pending Listings**:\n",
      "   - Stabilization at higher levels. Projected pending listings at approximately 500,000-550,000 into mid-2024 increasing slightly towards year-end if market conditions maintain positive trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Median Listing Price per Square Foot**:\n",
      "   - Expect a continuation of the upward trend. Likely to increase by around 5-6% annually, peaking around $240-$245 per square foot by the end of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Total Listing Count**:\n",
      "   - Would continue to stabilize or potentially increase slightly, alongside the overall market inventory trend.\n",
      "   - **Estimated Total Listing**: Around 1.1-1.2 million going into late 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Pending Ratio**:\n",
      "    - Likely to stabilize at a near-balanced market indicator level ranging between 0.6-0.7 over this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "These projections consider the current trends observed in the provided data and general real estate market trajectory accounting for seasonal fluctuations and potential external economic impacts.\n"
