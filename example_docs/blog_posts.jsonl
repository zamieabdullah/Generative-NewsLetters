Key Market Movers and How to Track Rates\n\n\nContent: \n\n\n\n\nIn This Article\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is presented by\u00a0Easy Street Capital. Read our\u00a0editorial guidelines\u00a0for more information.\nAfter a decade of relative stability in mortgage rates, the last few years have seen unprecedented volatility and changes in mortgage rates. Interest rates are often a key concern for real estate investors, as mortgages are often the difference between a cash-flowing deal and a dud.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince spring 2022, when the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest rate-hiking cycle, interest rates on the most popular loans for real estate investors, DSCR loans (part of the non-QM loans category), have moved at unprecedented rates. Many months of rates moving at most a few basis points a week morphed into dramatic, massive movements\u2014with bigger changes sometimes happening in one day than had occurred in quarters or years prior.\nReal estate investors navigating the challenging market of 2024\u2014with mortgage rates still at elevated levels\u2014are at an advantage when they can lock in financing terms or plan purchases while DSCR loan rates are favorable. But figuring out what to look for and what moves mortgage markets can be challenging.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll help pull back the curtain a bit on the biggest drivers of mortgage rates, as well as how investors can watch the market like a financial expert does.\nBond Market Concepts: What Determines Mortgage Rates?\nIn the United States in 2024, mortgage rates are generally tied to the overall bond market, as most residential mortgages, including conventional qualifying mortgages for owner-occupants, residential investment mortgages (DSCR loans), and even other alternative residential mortgages (non-QM), are securitized. This means they are bundled together and turned into bonds, financial instruments that pay out interest (yield) to investors looking for a steady, fixed return. These investors are typically large financial institutions looking for safe, predictable returns, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks.\nKey concepts to understand in economics and finance are risk and reward. Risk should be thought of neither as good nor bad, but rather always in relation to the associated reward or returns.\u00a0\nFor example, a 10% return (or reward) can be worth the risk if you are investing in a Class A single-family rental in a great market with an A+ tenant, but not worth the risk at all if betting on a 16-seed to make it to the Final Four in March Madness.\nInvestors in mortgage bonds utilize the risk-and-reward framework when allocating how to invest capital. Mortgage bonds have multiple alternatives they weigh against. As such, one of the biggest drivers of mortgage rates are other options investors have for returns.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen people refer to the Federal Reserve \u201csetting rates,\u201d they mean the effective federal funds rate or the rate at which banks charge other institutions on an overnight basis. Since banks can earn this yield with essentially zero risk, other alternatives (with risk) would need to provide higher returns. This is why when the Fed hikes or cuts rates, it affects all other sorts of financial instruments.\nHowever, the main benchmark for bonds, including mortgage bonds, is U.S. Treasury bonds, which are issued by the United States federal government. While the current fiscal trajectory of the country certainly has some issues, this is generally referred to in finance as the \u201crisk-free\u201d rate\u2014and the main economic alternative to mortgage bonds.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne key insight is that conventional mortgage bonds (mortgage-backed securities, or MBS) made up of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)-backed mortgages are benchmarked with the United States 10-year Treasury bond, while MBS made up of non-QM mortgage loans (including the all-important ones for real estate investors, DSCR loans) are benchmarked with the United States five-year Treasury bond.\u00a0\nThese mortgage bonds trade with a spread, or higher amount of rate/return needed, versus the Treasury bonds to account for the higher risks. Investing in mortgage notes backed by homeowner and real estate investor borrowers is riskier for investors than notes backed by the U.S. federal government. Generally, the spread to account for the higher risk has historically been around 170 basis points (or 1.7%); however, in the last few years, this has ballooned to around 300 basis points (or 3%) amidst lots of volatility.\nWithout delving too much deeper into the math and financial fixed-income calculations, mortgage bonds generally have yields or returns based on the main alternative for note investors, which are U.S. Treasury bonds. When bonds are sold, these yields go up, meaning investors demand higher returns for the risk. When bonds are bought, yields go down, meaning investors are OK with lower returns.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis means mortgage lenders will generally move their mortgage rates up and down based on corresponding movements in the Treasury bond market. And the biggest drivers for changes in yields in Treasury bonds are economic data that informs investors\u2019 guesses about future decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or lower the ultimate benchmark rate: the effective federal funds rate.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor DSCR loan interest rates, this generally means tracking movements in five-year Treasury bonds (this is the best investor alternative for DSCR loans since the average duration a borrower holds a DSCR loan before selling or refinancing is around five years).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Numbers vs. Expected Numbers\nBefore diving into the main financial data pieces to follow that move yields, a final, very important financial concept to cover is how the markets interpret data. The key point is that data is typically interpreted as compared to expectations rather than month-over-month or year-over-year numbers.\u00a0\u00a0\nTypically, banks, funds, and traders will have an expectation or estimate on key economic data releases, often created through sophisticated, complex financial models. As such, when a number comes in, the most important thing to consider is how it compares to what it was expected to be by the market rather than anything else.\u00a0\nThis is why there can be muted market responses to actual Fed rate hikes, as the central bank often telegraphs its intentions ahead of time, to the point where the change is fully expected/estimated and thus \u201cpriced in\u201d ahead of time.\nKey Economic Data Releases that Move Mortgage Rates\nHere are the key economic data releases that most affect Treasury yields and mortgage rates; understand these and plug them into your calendar, and you will be a mortgage rate magician in no time.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nFor even casual interest rate watchers, it should come as no surprise that the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) release is key to interest rate movements. CPI measures general inflation for consumers for major individual expenses such as food, gas, shelter, and other basics. A key driver of Fed interest rate policy is to fight the recent elevated inflation that has been plaguing the country since 2021.\nCPI is released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) once a month (usually around the midpoint of the following month) at 8:30 a.m. ET. The \u201cheadline\u201d number or main number typically seen in media reports, is the percentage change in inflation versus the prior year. So, for example, a release of an \u201call items index\u201d rise of 3.4% for April 2024 means that prices rose by 3.4% when compared to prices in April 2023.\nRemember that while the overall number is important and comparisons to the prior year and prior month are key, the main factor that affects interest rates (and thus, mortgage rates) is the number (percent change year over year) versus expectations. The expectation, in this case, is typically a median number from the models of the major banks.\u00a0\u00a0You might also likePrivate Money7 of the Best Alternative Real Estate Investing StrategiesPrivate MoneyPrivate Lending or Landlording: What Makes More Sense Right Now?Private MoneyHow to Become a Hard Money Lender (And Build Wealth Today)Private Money10 Important Terms To Know When Applying For A Hard Money Loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the structure of expectations for a CPI release (sometimes called \u201cprint\u201d). CPI coming in above estimates generally means that mortgage rates will rise (as this will cause the Federal Reserve to lean toward higher interest rates to fight inflation that\u2019s greater than expected) and vice versa (lower than expected would cause mortgage rates to fall). If mortgage rates come in exactly as estimated by the banks, Treasury yields and mortgage rates will likely not move much.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you have ever been confused as to why a big decrease or increase in CPI didn\u2019t seem to move things, this is probably why.\nJobs report\nAnother key monthly economic data release from the BLS that can greatly affect interest rates is the jobs report, which estimates how many overall jobs (nonfarm payroll employment) were added or subtracted in the prior month, as well as a calculation of the unemployment rate.\nIn 2024, this report may have overtaken CPI as the biggest market mover, as many financial experts expect the Fed to potentially cut rates if large job losses occur and the unemployment rate spikes, even if inflation had not yet returned to the 2% target.\nThese reports are typically released on Friday mornings, also at 8:30 a.m. ET, once per month. Like CPI, the most important factor for how it will affect yields and mortgage loan rates is the reported numbers versus estimates (for both change in number of jobs and unemployment rate percentage), rather than comparisons to prior time frames.\nJobless claims\nWhile the CPI report and jobs report are typically the biggest monthly market movers, the release of jobless claims also has a big effect on yields and mortgage rates. This report is weekly, not monthly, and is released every Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. It measures the number of both people newly filing for unemployment and continuing claims. Like the previous monthly reports, the market typically reacts to numbers in comparison to estimates.\nProducer Price Index (PPI)\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) report is similar to CPI; however, it tracks costs (and inflation) for producers, such as product manufacturers or service suppliers. This report is monthly and typically comes out the day following the CPI report. While it can have an effect on yields and mortgage rates if it comes in higher or lower than expectations, it typically has a much smaller effect on yields and rates than the CPI report.\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report is another measure of inflation. This one is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis instead of the Department of Labor. It is typically released about two weeks after the more well-known CPI report.\u00a0\nWhile the CPI report is generally more well-known, the PCE Index is becoming the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation. It\u2019s gaining more attention from market watchers and is considered more comprehensive data. This is also a monthly report released at the standard 8:30 a.m. ET time.\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, commonly referred to as the JOLTS report, is another closely watched data release from the BLS that can move rates up and down. This is a monthly report that shows how many job openings are currently posted in the U.S.\u00a0\nLike other monthly data reports from the BLS, the market reaction to this report is mostly about job openings versus expectations. One quirk of this data release is that it comes out at 9 a.m. ET instead of 8 a.m. ET, like most other reports. This can lead to mortgage market movement a bit later in the morning than people are used to.\u00a0\nOne recently highlighted issue regarding the JOLTS report, however, is that it is truly a survey\u2014reliant on responses from companies. The BLS has highlighted this issue, noting a sharp decline in response rates over the last decade.\u00a0\nThe fact that a lot of this data is now estimated has a lot of market experts calling into question whether this data is reliable\u2014and provides an opening for entrepreneurial people and companies to look for other ways to measure the data.\nFed meetings, minutes, and media interactions\nWhile Federal Reserve meetings are when specific rate changes (or no changes) are announced, by the time the actual announcement happens, markets and rates rarely change too much since the move is generally predicted and priced in. (If you would like to track market expectations of rate changes, the FedWatch tool from the CME Group is extremely useful.)\nHowever, yields and mortgage rates can be greatly changed by Federal Reserve actions\u2014the real drivers are the policy press releases and press conferences (typically scheduled for the early afternoon, a couple of hours after the publication of the decision). There, market traders decipher the statements of the Federal Reserve Chair, as well as answers to questions from the press. Yields can dramatically spike up and down during the press conference.\nAdditionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve meetings are usually released a couple of weeks after the date of the decision and release. While the lag between the meeting occurrences and the minute\u2019s release makes much of the data stale, the minute\u2019s releases can indeed move markets, as investors can gain further insight into the conversations among voting members.\nAn additional driver of rates is the quarterly release of a \u201cdot plot\u201d showing each Fed official\u2019s projection for interest rates for the upcoming couple of years. Since this chart is harder to boil down to a single expectation number like the previously discussed reporting metrics, this rarer release can affect yields, as it provides an infrequent insight into the longer-term rate outlook from Federal Reserve officials.\nUniversity of Michigan Survey\nAs inflation has taken center stage in the last few years in the United States, formerly minor surveys and data releases have increased in importance and their effect on Federal Reserve rate thinking and, thus, mortgage rates. A monthly survey conducted by the University of Michigan that measures consumer sentiment and inflation expectations has affected yields and offered a data point for predicting Federal Reserve actions.\nPurchasing Managers Index (PMI)\nAnother factor starting to gain steam in terms of affecting mortgage rates are various regional Purchasing Managers Index reports, which offer a glimpse into the health of the economy. A sharp downturn in economic metrics (leading to higher unemployment) is seen by most bond market experts as the likely catalyst for the next rate of sharply reduced rates. So when we have seen recent low readings (versus expectations) of some of these types of reports lately, yields and rates have fallen.\u00a0\nOne example of a PMI report is the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which determines the health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. To follow these reports, it\u2019s critical to understand how the metric is derived\u2014in this case, there is a score given between 0 and 100, with 50 meaning stable, above 50 equating to expansion, and below 50 indicating a contraction.\nAuctions\nLarge Treasury auctions, or large sales of new Treasury bonds by the United States federal government, have also had an effect on mortgage rates. These large sales can move bonds higher or lower, depending on investor appetite and pricing.\u00a0\nUnlike most of the other reports that generally come early in the morning, before many mortgage lenders release rates for the day, these typically occur in the middle of the day or afternoon and can be responsible for midday mortgage rate moves.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile the bond market and U.S. financial system can be daunting and complex, following changes in DSCR loan rates (rental property mortgage rates), it mostly boils down to future expectations for Federal Reserve rate decisions\u2014which are primarily driven by various economic data reports that measure inflation and the strength of the jobs market.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen will mortgage rates drop? Nobody knows for sure, but if you are tracking these indicators and start seeing data showing inflation coming in below expectations, with fewer new jobs and more unemployment, a drop in investment property loan interest rates will surely soon follow.\nFollow the author of this article, Easy Street Capital Partner Robin Simon, on multiple social platforms, including X and BiggerPockets, for daily market insights as well!\n\n\n\nThis article is presented by Easy Street Capital\n\nEasy Street Capital is a private real estate lender headquartered in Austin, Texas, serving real estate investors around the country.

Late rent payments disrupt your cash flow and cause unnecessary stress. You may also struggle to cover mortgage payments and pay bills when rent doesn\u2019t come in on time.\u00a0\nThe solution? Know how to collect rent from tenants on time every month. This ensures healthy cash flow and boosts your bottom line.\nRent collection should never be a game of \u201ccatch me if you can.\u201d After all, chasing tenants for late rent is never as much fun as chasing after Fido, who\u2019s run off with your prized possession. Tenants need proper training to deliver rent on time. And training starts with implementing the correct methods and tools to collect rent every month.\nWhat are the best ways to optimize the rent collection process and avoid late or missed payments? We\u2019ll examine the best methods to collect rent and discuss traditional ways of collecting rent versus online rent payments. In the end, you can decide on the best solution for you and your tenants.\nTenant Rent Collection Methods: Traditional vs. Online\nYour chosen payment method significantly impacts efficient rent collection. Many landlords still rely on paper checks, whereas there is a growing shift toward using online platforms or ACH bank transfers. Let\u2019s compare these methods to find out how to collect rent from tenants on time.\nTraditional methods\nTraditional methods for collecting rent are cash or a paper check. What are the pros and cons of these methods?\n\nPhysical checks: The most common method is for tenants to mail rent checks. This is convenient for them, and the check is delivered to you. However, this process can become time-consuming if you have several rental properties. For example, you must drive to the bank, deposit the money, and wait for the checks to clear. Then you deal with bounced checks and the old excuse of \u201cThe check is in the mail, it must be lost.\u201d\nIn-person rent collection: Collecting cash in person is not an acceptable payment method. There are several reasons why. First, you should never collect cash payments because it\u2019s unsafe. Second, you put yourself in the \u201cchasing rent\u201d category. Third, it\u2019s ineffective and wastes your precious time.\nTenants drop rent off at your home: Collecting rent in person at home is another big no-no. Giving out your home address to tenants is never a good idea. Do you really want an angry tenant showing up on your doorstep because you sent a late rent notice? Remember, you\u2019re running a rental property business, not a hobby. So, try to keep your business and personal life as separate as possible.\n\nIn summary, while traditional rent collection methods like physical checks may be convenient, they also have several drawbacks. They are inefficient for timely rent collection, especially when modern methods exist.\nOnline rent collection\nSeveral online payment solutions can help ensure consistent rent collection. These methods range from online banking transfers to money transfer apps and dedicated rent collection platforms.\nLet\u2019s look at the best online rent collection systems to streamline your rental business and ensure a steady income from your properties.\n\nACH payments: This system simplifies the rent collection process. You no longer must process physical checks or cash. Also, automatic payments reduce the administrative burden for you and your tenants. However, it\u2019s a good idea to check out bank fees for setting up and accepting ACH transfers.\nDirect deposit: Getting tenants to set up direct deposit can help ensure regular rental income. A direct deposit is a form of ACH transfer where the money arrives directly in your bank account. While direct deposits are free for the sender (tenant), you may have to pay transaction fees to receive the money.\nOnline rent payment platforms: One of the best ways to collect rent is to use a rent payment app. In many cases, these rent collection platforms do more than facilitate rental payments. They often include late payment fee collection, handling maintenance requests, managing security deposits, and reporting rent payment history to credit bureaus.\nPayNearMe: Tenants who don\u2019t have a bank account can use PayNearMe to pay monthly rent in cash. They use their unique card to pay at a local ACE Cash Express, 7-Eleven, or similar vendor. The tenant receives proof of payment, and you get instant notification of money in your bank account. This method to collect rent is free for landlords and costs tenants a small fee.\nCash apps: Money transfer apps like PayPal, Wise, Venmo, Apple Pay, or Zelle are convenient ways to send and receive money. But are they a way to collect rent from tenants? These peer-to-peer payment services are not the best options for rental property owners. For example, you cannot block partial payments during an eviction process. Also, transaction fees can be costly if you have many rental properties.\n\nOnline rent collection is convenient and efficient, making it popular among landlords. However, not every option will work for you, depending on your business and tenants. Therefore, you must decide which is the most suitable to ensure efficient rent collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Rent Collection Method to Choose?\nKnowing how to collect rent efficiently requires balancing convenience and efficiency for you and your tenants. Tenants may prefer sending rent by mail because it\u2019s easier for them. On the other hand, online payment collection methods are quick, convenient, and secure.\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the various rent collection methods.\nMethodCost*\u00a0SecureConvenience*Recurring payments?Automaticlate fees?Instant notifications?Block partialpayments?Report tocredit bureaus?Propertymanagement?Paper checksFreeModerateModerateNoNoNoYesNoNoIn-person collectionTravel to propertiesLowLowNoNoNoYesNoNoACH payments/direct depositLow feesYesHighYesNoYesYesNoNoRent payment appsLow feesYesHighYesYesYesYesYesYesCash appsLow feesYesModerateNoNoYesNoNoNoPayNearMeNoneHighHighNoNoYesNoNoNo\n* The cost and convenience are from the landlord\u2019s perspective.\u00a0You might also likeLandlording & Property ManagementWhat to Do When a Tenant Violates the Lease: A Landlord\u2019s GuideLandlording & Property ManagementThe Ultimate Move-In Checklist for LandlordsLandlording & Property ManagementA Landlord\u2019s Guide to Legally Breaking a LeaseLandlording & Property ManagementHow to Market Your Rental Property (8 Tips for Landlords)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Concerns About Collecting Rent From Tenants\nSwitching to online rent collection methods can raise concerns for landlords. For example, you may worry about security, handling late payments, and compliance with local and state rental laws. Additionally, you may need to convince tenants to switch to an online rent payment service.\nLet\u2019s address common concerns about how to collect rent from tenants using modern methods.\nSecurity and privacy\nEnsuring the privacy and security of tenants\u2019 personal and financial information is vital. As a landlord, you must adopt securely encrypted payment methods and adhere to data protection regulations to prevent fraud and identity theft.\nThe good news is that online payment platforms offer robust security measures. These platforms use encryption technology to protect sensitive information like bank account numbers and credit card details. They also adhere to industry regulations like the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).\nGetting tenants on board\nOne of the biggest challenges is convincing tenants to switch to an online rent payment system. Tenants may be hesitant to start using a system they\u2019re unfamiliar with. Also, as of 2022, reports indicate that 58% of the 24 million offline households don\u2019t see the need to be online, and 18% of these say they cannot afford a home internet service.\nClear communication about the benefits of paying rent online is critical to make the transition. Explain its convenience, like recurring payments, proof of payment, and rent payment history, as well as no more paper checks getting lost in the mail or ending up in the wrong hands.\nIntegration with accounting systems\nRent collection software often features seamless integration with accounting systems. Think of how much time you save on lodging paper checks. Not only does this cut down on administrative work, but it also minimizes the risk of errors.\nHandling late payments\nAny landlord knows that late payments disrupt cash flow and add stress. What can you do if your tenant misses a rent payment?\nEffective communication is crucial in resolving disputes. Therefore, try to understand why the rent is late. However, you must also understand local landlord-tenant laws and check the lease agreement to take appropriate action.\nIn most cases, you should charge late rent fees. Of course, this may sound callous if the tenant is facing a temporary hardship. But it will help to ensure on-time rent payments in the future.\nHere are a few tips on resolving issues with late payment of rent:\n\nHave a clear late fee policy in the rental agreement.\nEncourage the tenant to borrow money or use a credit card to pay rent.\nOffer a partial payment agreement if appropriate.\n\nPayment verification\nOnline payments resolve the problems of payment tracking and verification. We all know that processing paper checks is time-consuming and cumbersome. Also, the tenant doesn\u2019t know when or if you receive their check in the mail. This process can lead to misunderstandings and late rent notices.\nOnline rent payment systems benefit both the tenant and landlord, as both parties can quickly and easily view payment records, ensuring the rent is paid on time.\nFees and costs\nManaging the costs associated with different payment methods can be a concern. Tenants may refuse to use a payment system that incurs extra transaction fees. Additionally, some online payment portals make it free to send money, but charge fees on receipt.\nTherefore, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various payment options is wise to ensure they don\u2019t impact your rental income.\nCompliance with laws\nNavigating local, state, and federal laws can be a nightmare for anyone running a rental business. So it\u2019s vital to keep up to date on regulations regarding rent collection, late fees, and eviction processes. Also, going online means complying with data protection laws and ensuring your systems are secure.\nSuccessful landlords realize the importance of hiring a lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant law. Additionally, digital payments and electronic file storage are safer than traditional methods if you have the proper security measures.\nTips for Encouraging On-Time Rent Payments\nRegular rental income is your bread and butter, so ensuring you collect rent from all tenants every month is crucial to your bottom line. What are the best ways to ensure timely rent payments and maintain a successful rental business?\nLet\u2019s examine a few ways to keep your rental cash flow healthy.\nClear communication\nFirst, you must have a clear, unambiguous rent collection policy in the lease agreement. Terms of the lease agreement regarding rent payments should include:\n\nThe monthly rent amount\nRent due day\nApproved payment methods\nGrace period for late rent payments (check local rental laws)\nLate fee policy\nRent increases\n\nBefore you draft the lease agreement, have a real estate attorney check it for compliance with local, state, and federal laws.\nTenant screening\nTenant screening is critical to ensuring on-time rent payments. Remember, letting a tenant into your rental property is easy, but it\u2019s much harder to get them out, even if they stop paying rent. Therefore, due diligence is crucial when screening tenants.\nEssential points in the screening process include:\n\nEmployment history\nRental background check, including previous evictions\nCredit history\nIncome at least three times the rent price\n\nSend reminders to tenants\nLet\u2019s face it: We\u2019re all busy\u2014including your tenants. So, a gentle reminder that rent day is approaching can help minimize late payments. You can set up automated emails or SMS messages or use the function in a rent payment app.\nOffer incentives for on-time rent payments\nEncourage tenants to make on-time payments by offering incentives. Here are a few ideas:\n\nOffer tenants a discount for punctual rent payments for a certain number of months.\nKnock $20 off the rental price when they pay before the due date.\nSet aside $5 each month when they pay rent on time, and reward them with a gift card when they renew their lease.\n\nSet up automatic rent payments\nEncourage tenants to set up recurring monthly payments through their bank or a rent collection platform. Automatic payments ensure you can collect rent every month without reminding the tenant.\nCredit reporting to encourage tenants to pay rent on time\nOffering to report on-time rent payments to credit bureaus is an excellent way to encourage on-time payments. This incentive benefits tenants who want to build their credit history. It can also incentivize them to switch to an online rent payment app.\nEnforce late fees\nCharging late fees per the rental agreement is always a good idea. Although it may be tempting to waive the fees, you risk allowing bad habits to develop. Also, if you waive the fees for one tenant, you may have to waive them for all the tenants in a multifamily property.\nOf course, individual tenants may have extenuating circumstances. If they are excellent tenants who always pay on time, you may decide to cancel the late fee.\nOffer flexible payment options\nThe traditional method of collecting rent on the first of the month may not work for all tenants. Many self-employed people work in the gig economy and don\u2019t receive wages on a specific day. So, offering to split rent payments into two or three installments a month may help you collect rent regularly with no late payments.\nOffer multiple payment options\nStatistics show that consumers are shifting to faster electronic payment methods. Therefore, offering options to pay rent by credit or debit card can boost on-time rent payments. This option can allow tenants to reap the benefits of credit card payments such as cash back, reward points, and bonuses.\nPartial rent payments\nUnfortunately, some good tenants get into temporary financial difficulty. Rather than serve an eviction notice, you could work out a mutually agreeable payment plan. This option could allow tenants to get back on their feet while you avoid a costly eviction process.\nOffering partial rent payments isn\u2019t suitable for every tenant, but it can help you keep good tenants experiencing short-term cash flow issues. As always, put everything in writing to communicate the terms for paying rent over an extended period.\nUse a rent collection app\nProperty management software can streamline the rent collection process. Chances are that most of your tenants already use smartphones. A rent payment app has features like automatic payments, instant notifications, and easy payment tracking, making collecting rent from tenants on time easier.\nFinal Thoughts\nLearning the art of rent collection is crucial for running a successful rental business. Implementing efficient, effective rent collection strategies can minimize stress, improve cash flow, and help maintain a positive relationship with your tenants.\nSwitching to online payment systems helps streamline the rent payment and collection process. To simplify the process, use clear communication, incentives, rent reminder emails, and recurring rent payments. This way, you can effectively collect rent from tenants on time every month.\n\n\n\n\nSave time and money with this refreshing guide to managing your own properties.\nIn The Self-Managing Landlord, Amelia McGee and Grace Gudenkauf share the secrets of efficient property management, tenant screening and onboarding, and scaling your business\u2014all to help you break free from the 9-to-5 grind and create lasting wealth through real estate.\n\nGet Your Copy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote By BiggerPockets: These are opinions written by the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of BiggerPockets.\n\n"}

According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures, between July 2022 and July 2023, eight of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the nation were in Texas.\nThe unassuming Dallas suburb of Celina saw meteoric growth of 26.6%, more than 53 times the nation\u2019s average growth rate of 0.5%. Following Celina were several smaller, less well-known Texas towns:\u00a0\n\nFulshear: 25.6% increase\nPrinceton: 22.3% increase\nAnna: 16.9% increase\nGeorgetown: 10.6% increase\nProsper: 10.5% increase\nForney: 10.4% increase\nKyle: 9% increase\u00a0\n\nLarger Texas towns fared well, too. Houston is currently the fourth-largest U.S. city, gaining on third-place Chicago.\nWhy Texas?\nFavorable taxes, jobs, lower-priced housing, a warm climate, and high-quality living have all driven the population surge from colder, high-priced Northern cities. However, the dramatic population increase in smaller towns might be more straightforward than that.\u00a0\n\u201cThe list of fastest-growing cities includes a lot of smaller cities that are not likely to be on many people\u2019s radar,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, in a press release. \u201cSmaller areas often top these lists because their smaller size makes it easier for them to see large percent changes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Affordable Are the Top Small Towns in Texas?\nAccording to Realtor.com data, affordability isn\u2019t always at the top of the list when choosing a place to live. Celina\u2019s median home price of $679,999 is way above the national average. Rather, it\u2019s coveted for its good schools and low crime rate. The hour-long commute to Dallas is also a plus.\u00a0\nSimilarly, Fulshear, also high on the list, has a median home price of $519,000 and is only an hour away from Houston.\nTexas Cash Flows, Too\nWhile some of the fastest-growing cities in Texas comprised pricey single-family homes, less expensive housing in the state also dominates the country\u2019s cash flow markets, too. Texas occupied six of the 10 most cash-flowing markets in the U.S., according to BiggerPockets data.\nWhy Southern Texas is a Great Place to Invest\nMcAllen, Texas, has been an investor favorite for years. According to BiggerPockets data, the city has a rent-to-price ratio of 0.84%, a median \u201cowner-occupied\u201d sales price of under $100,000, and a median rent price of around $800. Low-cost housing and rents mean that many investors can scale quickly.\u00a0\nAlthough Realtor.com data tells a slightly different story, with the median home price sold being $285,300, this is likely due to the vast spread of house prices between lower and higher in the city, which offers multiple types of employment, from consulting services, financial services, medical, and education. Homes valued at around $150,000 in 2023 experienced an 80% increase in market value over the preceding five years. Other areas saw prices increase by over 100% in the same period as residents from California and elsewhere relocated during the pandemic amid the remote working boom.\nBiggerPockets data reveals that the other southern Texas cities of Odessa, Corpus Christi, and El Paso also dominate the highest cash flow cities in the country due to affordability. The border towns and Gulf areas offer multiple types of employment, from military bases to medical, e-commerce fulfillment centers, food processing, and energy. In an age of high interest rates, these affordable Texan towns with robust employment make them great places to invest, either as an all-cash buyer or with a larger down payment, to refinance once rates fall.\nBeware of Rising Property Taxes\nThough many parts of Texas offer affordable housing, pricier cities that have appreciated significantly in recent years have seen property taxes soar, making them some of the most expensive in the country.\u00a0\nAccording to a recent analysis by Axios, median property taxes on Texas single-family homes grew by 26% between 2019 and 2023 without accounting for inflation. Lawmakers have been trying to stem the increases and have had some success. Many property owners across the state saw their taxes fall by 28% in 2023.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it\u2019s a much more taxpayer-friendly environment, particularly for homeowners, than it was before 2019, and even more so after last year\u2019s increase in the homestead exemption,\u201d Lynn Krebs, a research economist at the Texas Real Estate Research Center at Texas A&M University, told Texastribune.org. Before the cuts, some residents saw their tax bill increase by as much as 31% between 2018 and 2023.You might also likeHousing MarketsThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate\u2014and Lessons From ItHousing MarketsMalta is a Hot, Stunning Island Market in Europe\u2014Here\u2019s How to Invest ThereHousing MarketsFlorida Is the Perfect Rent-to-Own Market\u2014Should You Take Advantage?Housing MarketsThese U.S. Cities Are Overflowing with Affordable Single-Family Homes Under $300k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe issue of property taxes is contentious. Dispensing with taxes that would otherwise have been used for school district maintenance is a tough sell beyond what has already been achieved. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told the Texas Public Policy Foundation last year that the state would need approximately $55 billion to offset the cost of school district maintenance for 2024-2025, amounting to almost two-fifths of the state\u2019s $144.1 billion general fund budget.\nShould taxes continue to increase without the relief of lower interest rates, investors would need to look closely at their bottom-line cash flow numbers and choose to invest with large down payments or as all-cash buyers. Those who invested over a decade ago have enjoyed some golden years in appreciation and cash flow.\u00a0\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean another halcyon era of Texas investing doesn\u2019t lie ahead. With businesses relocating and cities attracting new residents, Texas remains a great place to deploy your cash. However, unless you\u2019re ready to put down a large amount of money, look at least for appreciation rather than cash flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

The best way I know how to tell this is through a story, which starts with my first real estate deal.\nAn Early-Morning Anxiety Attack\nMany people might not know this, but I did my first real estate deal 90 days after experiencing a panic attack. I had this panic attack in the middle of the night, triggered by the realization that the poor financial decisions I made as a single man were now negatively impacting my new wife. We couldn\u2019t buy a home together because my credit was in such bad shape. I couldn\u2019t even be on the loan for our house, and we almost missed out on our first home purchase because of my credit issues.\nAs I grappled with the fact that I couldn\u2019t help purchase our first home, it dawned on me that many of our future dreams\u2014like having kids, buying our dream house, living in a great school district, and going on vacations\u2014were out of reach, given our financial situation. This realization led to a panic attack at 3 a.m.\u00a0\nDesperate for a solution, I began Googling ways to make extra money. This search led me to articles on BiggerPockets, where I saw that ordinary people were buying and owning real estate to build wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Plan of Action\nAt that moment, I made a decision: I would figure out how to be a successful real estate investor no matter what. Despite having bad credit (sub-600 score) and only $1,000 in my savings account, I felt a sense of peace about this. I believed that if others on BiggerPockets could figure it out, so could I.\nI knew I needed to surround myself with other real estate investors to propel myself down this path, so I started attending meetups, being very purposeful about which ones I went to, how often I attended, where I sat, and how I offered value to others so I could learn from them. I also began telling everyone that I was an investor. Even though I didn\u2019t know how to be one yet, I understood that you get what you give in this world. By putting it out there that I was a real estate investor, I hoped the universe would return the favor.\nMy First Deal\nThis approach led to my first deal. A friend called, saying he heard I was buying houses. He had to sell his house in 30 days to purchase a property from his church and offered to sell it to me at a significant discount\u2014$116,000 for a house worth between $165,000 and $175,000. I agreed, even though I had no idea how to proceed. I literally Googled \u201chow to buy a house\u201d and learned about putting it under contract.\nWith the contract in hand, I went to the nearest bank, which was a small community bank, and asked for help. The commercial loan officer in the lobby saw it was a good deal and offered to finance it if I could provide a 15% down payment. I didn\u2019t have the $15,000 needed, but I considered this good news. It meant I only needed $15,000 instead of $115,000.You might also likeFinding DealsWhy Successful Real Estate Investing Is All About Finding the Right DealFinding DealsHow Our Deal Broke Down at the Last Minute\u2014And Why I\u2019m Happy About ItFinding DealsSix Sources of Deals That Investors and Agents Can Capitalize on in Any MarketFinding DealsHow to Navigate Today\u2019s Real Estate Market\u2014Top Tips From Three Expert Investors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuring My Financing\nI reached out to my network of real estate investors from the meetups for advice on finding the money. I learned about borrowing against a 401(k) without incurring penalties and taxes. My wife had a 401(k) and agreed to borrow against it so we could buy the property. We had the money within two weeks, bought the property, and rented it out. The cash flow paid back the 401(k) loan.\nThis experience taught me that you can get good funding if you have a good deal. The bank later offered me a line of credit on the equity in the property to use as down payments for future deals. This made me focus on finding good deals because I now had the financing in place.\nI started studying the art of real estate investing, learning from successful investors and wholesalers about generating leads and finding deals. While I didn\u2019t want to wholesale, I adopted this strategy to generate leads for myself. I focused on direct mail as my primary strategy but learned various methods for finding off-market and on-market deals.\nFinal Thoughts\nFinding the right strategy involves balancing your resources\u2014time or money\u2014with your personality. For me, direct mail worked best, and I consistently implemented it to find good deals. Every strategy for finding deals works; you just need to find one that suits you and stick with it.\nThe foundation of a strong real estate business is finding good deals. A good deal with equity gives you options\u2014whether to sell, rent, flip, or wholesale. It\u2019s your safety net in the real estate industry.\nThank you all for being part of my journey.

It\u2019s a topic that dominates articles, BiggerPockets forum posts, YouTube videos, and conversations within the industry\u2014and for good reason. Finding deals is the lifeblood of real estate investing.\u00a0\nHere are four key reasons why a successful real estate investor focuses so much on finding the deal.\n1. It Solves the Biggest Problem Investors Face\nThe No. 1 reason why real estate investors are all about finding deals is that it\u2019s the biggest challenge they face. No matter who they are, every real estate investor encounters this problem at some point. It\u2019s one of the biggest barriers to entry in becoming a successful real estate investor.\u00a0\nThink about the most successful businesses in the world: They found a problem that most of their audience faces and then provided a solution. If you can solve the problem of finding deals, you can essentially make money for as long as you want.\nSolving this core need is beneficial not only for you but also for those around you. A good deal is essentially making money in real estate. You often hear the phrase, \u201cWe make money on the buy, not on the sell.\u201d This directly points to your ability to find good deals.\u00a0\nIf you can buy a deal properly, you\u2019ve positioned yourself to make money. Successful real estate investors either have solved this problem or are actively working on it. As technology evolves, new opportunities for finding deals emerge, and the market shifts, requiring investors to stay on top of their game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. It\u2019s the Best Protection Strategy\nInvesting in any asset, whether it\u2019s the stock market, cryptocurrency, or real estate, involves risk. The most successful real estate investors are those best prepared for these risks and who position themselves to mitigate them as much as possible. The better you mitigate risk, the more profitable you\u2019ll be.\nWhen it comes to real estate, buying a deal with a good equity spread is the best protection against many risks. Overpaying for a property means there\u2019s no equity in the deal, which can lead to various problems. If the market shifts and property values drop, having a property with a good amount of equity protects you. Even if values decrease, you\u2019re still into the property for less than it\u2019s worth, giving you options to sell or rent without taking a loss.\n3. It\u2019s the Lowest Common Denominator Among All Exit Strategies\nAll exit strategies\u2014flipping houses, long-term rentals, mid-term rentals, short-term rentals, and wholesaling\u2014require one thing: a good deal. If you focus on finding good deals, you can pivot among different strategies as needed, whether you\u2019re flipping, renting, or wholesaling.\nBuying a good deal means you can monetize the property in whatever way makes sense for you. If you want to be a landlord, you need a property that will cash flow. If you want to flip, you need a deal with enough spread to make a profit.\u00a0\nThe common denominator for any successful strategy is buying a good deal.You might also likeFinding DealsFrom a Panic Attack To My First Deal in Just 90 Days: How I Mastered Real Estate Deal FindingFinding DealsHow Our Deal Broke Down at the Last Minute\u2014And Why I\u2019m Happy About ItFinding DealsSix Sources of Deals That Investors and Agents Can Capitalize on in Any MarketFinding DealsHow to Navigate Today\u2019s Real Estate Market\u2014Top Tips From Three Expert Investors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. It\u2019s the Trigger Point for Everything Else in Real Estate Investing\nFinding a good deal is the trigger point that makes everything else in real estate investing relevant. To purchase property, renovate it, and rent it out, you need connections\u2014financing, contractors, and title companies. But having a good deal makes lining up these connections easier.\nWithout a deal, getting banks to discuss loan products, contractors to provide bids, or title companies to assist is challenging. However, when you have a good deal, banks, contractors, and title companies are more willing to work with you. A good deal gives you leverage to get everything else in place.\nFinal Thoughts\nSuccessful real estate investors focus on finding the deal because it\u2019s the biggest problem new investors face, the best protection strategy, the lowest common denominator for any exit strategy, and the trigger point that makes everything else easier.\u00a0\nI hope this helps.

You can\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m raising my hands, feet, and even the hairs on my neck.\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) recently made news by launching a 0%-down mortgage program. And it reminds many real estate analysts of the subprime mortgage frenzy that helped fuel the market collapse back in 2008.\u00a0\nSo, as you scope out the new program, what\u2019s the potential impact on real estate investors?\u00a0\nA Summary of UWM\u2019s 0%-Down Program\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the facts. The program allows lower-income first-time borrowers\u2014those earning a household income below 80% of the local median household income\u2014to borrow up to 97% of the purchase price. The remaining 3%, or what would ordinarily be the down payment, UWM covers with an interest-free second mortgage.\u00a0\nBorrowers don\u2019t make monthly payments against the second mortgage. When they sell or refinance the property, they must repay both the first and second mortgages in full.\u00a0\nThis sounds like an awesome deal for the borrower. All things being equal, I\u2019d take that deal as a borrower. Who doesn\u2019t love interest-free financing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat About House Hacking?\nThe first thought that popped into my head when BiggerPockets asked me for my thoughts on how this loan program might impact investors was, \u201cWow, that\u2019d be great for house hacking.\u201d\nIf you could buy a duplex, triplex, or fourplex with no money down and have it cash flow enough to cover your mortgage payment, you immediately step into free housing and a property that appreciates over time. And your mortgage payment stays fixed even as rents rise year after year, growing your cash flow over time.\u00a0\nAfter a year of living in the property to fulfill the owner occupancy requirements, you could then use the money you saved on housing payments to buy another multifamily to house hack. You couldn\u2019t use the UWM program a second time, but you could use Fannie Mae\u2019s or Freddie Mac\u2019s 3% down program or put down 3.5% on an FHA loan. And you would no longer be confined by the income limit at that point.\u00a0\nEven so, that income limit would disqualify many, even most would-be house hackers. Food for thought.\u00a0\nRisks and Impacts of 0% Down Mortgage Programs\nI see a few risks with these kinds of programs, as well as their impacts on a few different groups. Here\u2019s a look at them.\nRisk of inflated home prices and bubbles\nFor many would-be homeowners, the down payment creates the main barrier to entry. Remove that barrier, and you suddenly have an influx of new buyers on the market. This drives up home prices and adds to the possibility of a housing bubble.\u00a0\nAll market bubbles burst sooner or later. And it wouldn\u2019t even require a bubble or a housing market correction to put a lot of homeowners underwater.\nRisk of underwater homes\nIn this case, home prices dipping even 3% would put these homeowners underwater on their mortgage. And that says nothing of all the closing costs involved in selling a home.\u00a0\nThey would be unable to sell, at least not without coming out of pocket with tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. This seems awfully unlikely for the low-income borrowers this program is designed to serve.\u00a0\nThat sets the stage for strategic defaults and foreclosures\u2014or, at the very least, short sales negotiated with lenders. These lenders may struggle to accommodate them in a down market.You might also likeOpinionThe Government Has Taken a Permanent Intellectual Vacation\u2014This New Plan is Evident of ThatOpinionThe Disaster That Is Canadian Real Estate\u2014and Lessons From ItOpinionNo, Cash is Not King\u2014You Can Do Way More and Way Better With FinancingOpinionBrian Took the Easy Way Out\u2014Here\u2019s Why He Made a Big Mistake and Why I\u2019m Never Selling My Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk of credit crunches and lender failures\nIf too many loans default or require short sales, lenders go into crisis mode. They tighten their lending standards or stop lending altogether.\u00a0\nSome may even fold. We saw two regional banks fail in early 2023 due to commercial real estate exposure and far tighter lending standards in the industry after that.\u00a0\nFinally, these loans get packaged and sold as securities. So, who ultimately takes many of the losses on them? You, me, pension funds, and other retail investors who have money tied up in these publicly traded funds and securities.\u00a0\nImpact on note and debt investors\nOver the last two years, secured notes and debts have actually performed pretty well. We\u2019ve seen strong returns on the ones we\u2019ve gone in on together in our passive real estate investment club at SparkRental.\nBut imagine a housing bubble forms, or at the very least, the market dips by 5% to 10% nationwide. Hard money lenders, private debt funds, and others offering secured debts will see their non-performing loans skyrocket and, therefore, their losses. That would be bad news for people like me who invest passively in debts secured by real estate.\u00a0\nImpact on private equity real estate investors\nIn our Co-Investing Club, we primarily go in on real estate syndications together.\u00a0\nA 2008-style housing-induced recession would drive up unemployment, which would, in turn, drive up rent defaults, evictions, and household bundling\u2014all bad news.\u00a0\nOne mitigating factor, if you want to call it that, is that some homeowners would become renters again, fueling demand for rental housing. But that\u2019s cold comfort for everyone involved.\u00a0\nOn the other end of the possibility spectrum, let\u2019s say the program does exactly what it aims to do: put homeownership within reach for millions of renters. They all leave the pool of renters and become homeowners, crushing demand for rental housing.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s hardly good news for passive investors in multifamily real estate syndications.\u00a0\nActivists Want It Both Ways\nWe\u2019ve all heard housing activists demand better access to homeownership for low-income families. I\u2019m not opposed to that. I can\u2019t think of anyone who is.\u00a0\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Read any article about the launch of UWM\u2019s 0%-down loan program, and you\u2019ll see quotes from those same housing activists warning about \u201csetting buyers up for failure,\u201d or \u201cticking time bombs,\u201d or \u201cthe subprime nightmare all over again.\u201d\nGuess what? Subprime mortgages were created at the request of those same housing activists, who demanded more credit accessibility for low-income borrowers. They wanted fewer barriers to entry.\u00a0\nThose barriers to entry keep the system stable. They ensure a minimum level of financial security among borrowers.\u00a0\nSo which is it? Do you want homeownership more accessible, or less? You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u00a0\nWhat About Investors?\nAs for real estate investors, just keep an eye on real estate market fundamentals. Watch out for frothiness. And when in doubt, invest more conservatively. Our No. 1 goal when we look at deals today as an investment club is protecting against downside risks.\u00a0\nWe like investments that can weather some choppiness in the market\u2014and you should, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

One mortgage lender has introduced a 0% down program in the hopes of attracting more buyers. While some critics are worried it\u2019s similar to the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial crash, others say it\u2019s nothing new.\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) announced its zero-down program in May. This program allows borrowers who qualify to get a mortgage and a second loan to cover the cost of the down payment. Borrowers can get a 3% down payment assistance loan of up to $15,000.\u00a0\nThis second loan will not accrue interest or have a monthly payment. Instead, the loan has to be paid back in full if the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off, or the borrower refinances.\nHomebuyers who want to take advantage of this program will need to be at or below 80% of the property address\u2019s area median income or be a first-time buyer.\nIs This a Repeat of the 2008 Housing Crisis?\nWhile UWM says no other wholesale lender is offering this type of program nationally, programs have been in place for years that assist buyers with low or no down payments, such as bond programs, housing authority assistance on a local level, and veteran loans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also offers zero-down home loans in some rural areas, while Bank of America launched a zero-down mortgage program in 2022 for some Black and Hispanic communities.\nStill, only a few of these programs exist, and they have many more controls that were set in place after the financial crisis. Lenders can no longer provide 100% financing on stated income, Lindsey Harn, a real estate agent in California, told BiggerPockets. \u201cThere is oversight on the financing, which far exceeds previous efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cLenders and banks are held to strict \u2018ability to repay\u2019 guidelines, which hold them accountable to ensuring that a borrower has the stability and means to meet their debt obligations.\u201d\nJosh Brotemarkle, president and general counsel at Centra Capital Partners, told BiggerPockets that the real estate boom seen during the early 2000s was partly fueled by interest-only mortgages, which, like zero-down mortgages, assume that real estate will appreciate in value. But real estate can depreciate, and people are likely to walk away if they owe more than the home is valued at.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile zero-down mortgages can help homebuyers purchase a new home, these programs are not without risk, he added.\n\u201cThe price to pay for programs that seek to curtail traditional lending practices is paid with a currency called \u2018moral hazard,\u2019\u201d Brotemarkle explained. \u201cMoral hazard occurs when people act in risky ways because they do not bear the full consequence of their actions. When borrowers are not at risk, they are less likely to care.\u201dYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020\u2014How Should You Approach Deals Now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Investors Benefit From Zero-Down Mortgages?\nUWM\u2019s zero-down program is aimed at homebuyers struggling to purchase a property, but that doesn\u2019t mean investors can\u2019t take advantage to buy a second property, provided they meet the requirements. Other zero-down programs could also be worth looking into, although their strict eligibility requirements and income requirements often mean that very few real estate investors qualify.\u00a0\nA down payment is one of the biggest barriers to real estate investing, and these loan products can help a lot of people build their wealth, Nicholas Ritacco, portfolio manager and director at IB Global, told BiggerPockets. \u201cIf investors can find options that work for them, I believe they have to do so with the right plan,\u201d he added.\nStill, many real estate experts say a zero-down mortgage might not make investment sense, as not putting any money down means you are starting out with little equity. One of the biggest risks is that these programs offer very high loan-to-value loans and are essentially all debt, said Ritacco. It also doesn\u2019t allow investors to refinance with an option to cash out.\nHarn agreed, as zero-down programs \u201care too restrictive in rate to make sense as a business model.\u201d\n\u201cA sufficient down payment and reserves should be used to ensure a property can adequately cover its debt service,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Houston is the most at risk southern city.Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, says the key is knowing exactly what your insurance policy covers and mitigating your risks based on that. \n\n\nHurricane season has started, and forecasts are not looking good. According to analytics company CoreLogic, more than 32.7 million homes from Texas to Maine are at risk of hurricane damage this year.\nThe season is expected to be very busy and possibly top the record books for the number of storms named. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts there could be as many as 25 total storms, with eight to 13 becoming hurricanes.\nExperts say the ocean is warming around the world. At the same time, the end of one of the strongest El Ninos ever observed could quickly transition to a La Nina, which generally causes more hurricanes over the Atlantic. The combination of warm weather and high winds could mean the perfect recipe for stronger storms this season.\u00a0\nMetro Areas Most at Risk of Hurricane and Storm Surges\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to know exactly who will be impacted this hurricane season, some areas could be harder hit than others, while not all homes will experience a total loss. Some could be damaged by flooding and storm surges, and others by wind.\nCoreLogic\u2019s 2024 Hurricane Risk Report identified the areas most at risk of damage from hurricane winds and storm surges. Areas with high population density in low-lying coastal areas are most at risk. However, how much a property could be damaged depends on various factors, such as elevation changes and any barriers to block water from moving inland.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a look at places with the most risk of damage from hurricane winds, as well as the reconstruction value from such phenomena.\nMetro AreaNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to hurricane windsReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York3,765,489$1.961Philadelphia, Pennsylvania1,657,757$703.6Houston, Texas2,092,308$671.3Boston, Massachusetts1,347,819$669.5Miami, Florida2,048,827$511.4Tampa, Florida1,107,320$294.5Providence, Rhode Island483,033$211.7Virginia Beach, Virginia583,928$186.4Jacksonville, Florida580,352$167.9Richmond, Virginia435,597$153.6Hartford, Connecticut353,537$150.3Bridgeport, Connecticut212,853$135.8New Orleans, Louisiana442,099$135.1North Port, Florida398,672$107.7\nMany of the metro areas with the most at-risk homes also tend to be in areas that are familiar with hurricane damage. Hurricane Sandy, for example, caused an estimated $19 billion in damages and lost economic activity across New York City in 2012. As the most densely populated city in the U.S., it\u2019s not a surprise that it tops the list of the most homes at risk of damage from storm surges and hurricane winds.\nHere\u2019s a look at those places most likely to see coastal flooding, as well as the reconstruction value.\nNumber of homes at moderate or greater risk to storm surgeReconstruction value (in billions)New York, New York878,226$415.4Virginia Beach, Virginia396,843$124.8Miami, Florida509,133$124.0Tampa, Florida448,013$109.5New Orleans, Louisiana320,908$99.3Cape Coral, Florida318,004$78.4North Port, Florida254,218$64.6Boston, Massachusetts148,005$59.5Naples, Florida196,454$54.9Charleston, South Carolina148,987$53.3Houston, Texas192,937$52.6Jacksonville, Florida154,177$46.1Philadelphia, Pennsylvania120,426$42.1Salisbury, Maryland138,295$40.9\nOther metro areas, such as Miami and Houston, are also familiar with hurricanes. According to NOAA\u2019s historical trackers, there have been 48 and 28 hurricanes within 60 nautical miles of Miami and Houston\u2019s counties since the beginning of the 20th century.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Protect Your Property During Hurricane Season\nFor homeowners and real estate investors who own property in areas that are more prone to hurricane and storm damage, it\u2019s essential to understand and know the risks these storms present to your property, Maiclaire Bolton-Smith, vice president of hazard and risk management at CoreLogic, told BiggerPockets. \u201cWhen you know your risk, you can accelerate your recovery,\u201d she added.\nShe added that the other key to preparing is to understand your insurance policy, knowing what is covered and what isn\u2019t. For example, flood insurance is not mandatory unless the property is mortgaged and in a FEMA-designated flood zone. If a property is damaged by flooding and isn\u2019t covered, you could end up footing the bill yourself.\n\u201cAs we have seen from events like Hurricane Harvey in 2017, flooding damage can be extreme and often not limited to designated flood zones, so understanding what is covered is critical. That\u2019s not something you want to find out after a home has sustained hurricane damage,\u201d Bolton-Smith said.\nBesides insurance, you can also fortify your home, such as making sure the roof is in good condition and there are no loose shingles, as well as ensuring there are no large trees or other items that could damage your home, she added.\u00a0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020\u2014How Should You Approach Deals Now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes It Still Make Sense to Buy In Areas Prone to Climate Disasters?\u00a0\nHurricanes and other climate disasters have been more frequent and extreme in recent years. This increases the risk of potential property damage and costs\u2014and has caused insurance premiums to skyrocket in many areas. And it seems that this trend will only get worse, with as many as 40 million homes at risk of a spike in insurance premiums.\u00a0\n\u201cThe reality is, risk of some kind is present in most places,\u201d said Bolton-Smith. She lives in California, which faces both earthquake and wildfire risks. And while it\u2019s unlikely a hurricane would hit every area mentioned in CoreLogic\u2019s report, there is a chance of multiple disaster events in one year.\nStill, technology and building codes have greatly improved to ensure that homes are fortified against risk, such as with magnesium siding or reinforced doors and windows.\nUltimately, \u201cI think it comes down to understanding the potential risk and deciding whether you\u2019re comfortable with it and knowing what resources you have to mitigate it,\u201d Bolton-Smith said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Read our\u00a0editorial guidelines\u00a0for more information.\nThe housing market is an increasingly challenging place for investors right now. The costs of investing in real estate are undoubtedly rising, with more funds required both upfront and on an ongoing basis. Additionally, competition for good investment leads is fierce amid an ongoing shortage of homes for sale.\nFortunately, there are solutions to these challenges. They lie in the realm of precision data collection and analysis.\nTop Real Estate Challenges in 2024\nHere, we will cover the most pressing challenges facing real estate investors right now, and the ways in which data-backed tools can help them make game-changing tweaks to their investing strategies.\u00a0\nLow inventory\nThe challenge of low inventory is persistent, with no current indicators that it will improve anytime soon. Low inventory has shaped the U.S. housing market since the spike in interest rates from the historic low of 2.65% in 2021. Since then, interest rates have tripled with a high of over 8%, causing homeowner reluctance to sell due to the lock-in effect. Home sales have slowed dramatically since 2022.\u00a0\nThe fact remains that current interest rates just cannot compete with the historically low rates homeowners locked in before 2022. Homeowners are hesitant to move and take on mortgages with much higher rates; their reluctance to sell is completely understandable. And although there are signs that interest rates are stabilizing, we\u2019re just not there yet in terms of what sellers would like to see\u2014and we won\u2019t be there in 2024.\u00a0\nAs Rick Sharga, founder, and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a market intelligence and business advisory firm, told Forbes, \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see a meaningful increase in the supply of existing homes for sale until mortgage rates are back down in the low-5% range, so probably not in 2024.\u201d\nLow inventory will continue propping up high home prices, and this will continue to present real estate investors with the challenge of finding affordable investment opportunities. However, there are ways investors can expand lead generation and maximize investment opportunities without having to wait for inventory to grow. The key is to identify off-market properties that are owned by motivated sellers\u2014people who want to and have to sell sooner rather than later and will be more flexible on selling price.\u00a0\nEnter PropStream. Its powerful data-filtering tools allows investors to search any market in the U.S. (over 155 million properties), identifying off-market properties with motivated homeowners who need to sell based on over 120 filter options.\u00a0\nThis granular approach means that an investor can have a much better understanding of what exactly is motivating a particular seller. A seller motivated by financial distress and/or threat of foreclosure requires a different approach from one desiring a home upgrade or a retiring homeowner wanting to downsize.\u00a0\nIdentifying motivated sellers with precision allows a potential investor to tailor the best possible offer that will be effective and attractive to the specific seller. This is a much better lead strategy overall than relying only on SEO and outbound marketing or referrals.\u00a0\nTraditional lead-generation methods simply do not capture the entirety of existing opportunities. As an investor, you also can really stand out from the crowd if you are making a personalized offer that takes the seller\u2019s specific circumstances into account.\u00a0\nHigh interest rates\nHigh interest rates hit investors, too, not just regular buyers. Inevitably, those higher monthly mortgage payments have to translate into higher rent charges, which can make it more difficult for investors to find and retain tenants.\nTo illustrate the point, the average monthly mortgage payment in the U.S. reached $2,268 in 2023, an almost 50% hike from only two years before, when the average monthly payment was only $1,525.\nHigher mortgage costs, coupled with rising home insurance costs, is bad news for investors at a time when rent growth is sluggish across the country. The solution? Access to more\u2014and more accurate\u2014data that will help investors identify better deals and combat the problem of higher monthly payments.\u00a0\nFor example, filtering a property search by mortgage type, rate, and mortgage balance can help you zoom in on investment opportunities where an existing, low-rate mortgage could be transferred to you or where the mortgage balance is low and can be paid off sooner, making your investment more profitable in the longer term.\nPropStream provides deep-dive insights into 155 million-plus properties nationwide, including mortgage and financial data. Armed with mortgage related information, you can make better investment decisions and achieve higher ROIs.\u00a0\u00a0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsHome Prices Have Increased by Almost 50% Since 2020\u2014How Should You Approach Deals Now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it\u2019s never wise to make an investment decision solely based on lower monthly payments. You may be focusing in on an area where there aren\u2019t suitable properties with transferable mortgages, for instance.\u00a0\nThe solution here is not to write off suitable leads with high-interest rate mortgages but to look into more financing options. Creative financing can be a viable option, for example.\u00a0\nRemember: As an investor, you are not necessarily as constrained by a budget as a buyer who plans to live at a property. If the home is a lucrative investment opportunity and ticks all the other boxes, it can be worth it to secure alternative financing.\u00a0\nHigh competition for affordable investment opportunities\nFinally, there is no way around the fact that the overall higher cost of housing across the U.S. is leading to lower returns, creating a feeding frenzy among investors for more affordable properties. Everybody wants below-market-value homes, and when these hit the market, fierce competition ensues.\u00a0\nMany investors rely on their local agents and the MLS to locate less expensive investment opportunities. The problem is that even if you have a good relationship with the agent and they have promised to alert you to new opportunities, it may just come down to where you are on their list of multiple investors.\u00a0\nThe solution? Stop competing, and look where no one else is. You have to search beneath the tip of the iceberg for properties that haven\u2019t yet been put on the market but could be soon.\u00a0\nWhat you need to do is identify homeowners with a high propensity to sell in your area, gather relevant data about the situation and the property, and then craft an offer that both gives the homeowner confidence to sell and gives them a valuable solution to whatever issue they may be having with the property.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to stress that you\u2019re not necessarily or exclusively looking at pre-foreclosure properties. A homeowner may be reluctant to sell because of the repairs the home needs (which they feel they can\u2019t afford) or because they have an insurance problem. There are a whole range of situations out there, and it should be your goal as an investor to tailor the best possible outcome for both yourself and the seller.\u00a0\nUtilizing PropStream\u2019s data, you can identify properties that present profitable opportunities based on sellers\u2019 current situations. Once you\u2019ve located homeowners likely to want to sell, you can put yourself in a strong negotiating position by having access to the right data about the property.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout PropStream\nPropStream\u00ae is the most trusted provider of comprehensive real estate data nationwide.

A study completed in November 2022 by researchers at the NYU Stern School of Business and Columbia University estimated a\u00a0$664.1 billion reduction\u00a0in real estate asset values from continued\u00a0remote work trends.\nNew York and LA Head Conversions\nMost of that number involves repurposing hotels\u2014an easier\u00a0transformation than remaking office spaces, which are also being converted, with Manhattan leading the charge. A small number involve converting industrial buildings such as factories. By far, the largest project in Manhattan is 525 Lexington Avenue. The building now houses 655 student apartments.\nLos Angeles has 5,881 units scheduled for conversion this year, while Manhattan has 4,363. Office conversions are at the top of many cities\u2019 agendas. Because of the\u00a0additional considerations, such as windows, plumbing, and electrical revisions, office conversions take longer than hotel conversions. However, they are still considered an environmentally friendly alternative to razing buildings and starting from scratch.\u00a0\n\u201cThe process minimizes the environmental impact associated with demolition and the production of new materials, making it an eco-friendly approach to design and construction,\u201d Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at commercial real estate data firm Yardi Matrix, said in the press release about the RentCafe report. \u201cAlthough these [office] buildings pose challenges for conversion into residential spaces due to factors like building age, size, configuration, and location, repurposing them helps alleviate the shortage of rental units at diverse price points, especially in areas where vacant or underused buildings are prevalent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax Revenue, Housing, and Vitality\nThe immediate advantages of additional city residential spaces include:\n\nMore tax revenue.\nVibrant 24/7 communities.\nBooming business for nearby restaurants and businesses.\nA much healthier urban ecosystem.\n\nAbout\u00a011%\u00a0of U.S. office buildings are good candidates for conversion, but one\u00a0of the prohibitive issues\u00a0is expense. The resultant apartments or condos would need to be high-end to pay for the undertaking. This\u00a0would do nothing to alleviate the affordability crisis many cities are facing.\u00a0\nHowever, a\u00a0study from Gensler\u00a0indicates that office conversions are less than one-third of the cost of new construction. Couple this with developer incentives, such as new\u00a0legislation\u00a0that provides a 20% credit for qualified property conversion expenditures with developers\u2014providing at least 20% of the resulting units are affordable housing to qualify\u2014and large-scale office conversions could provide a way to revitalize city centers, offering much-needed affordable housing in the process.\nThe Benefit for Real Estate Investors\nIn the short term, the additional tax revenue allows cities to function better. It means residential landlords in the city boroughs won\u2019t see a spike in their real estate taxes, and essential city services such as sanitation, police, education, and fire departments will be better funded, making cities better places to live. Also, adding affordable, much-needed inventory to the market could stabilize and even decrease exorbitant, escalating prices, allowing more people to\u00a0get onto\u00a0the housing ladder and create more well-balanced cities of full-time residents.\u00a0\nIn the long term, as cities become desirable places to live and socialize, as has happened in cities like\u00a0Detroit, the knock-on effect benefits the entire\u00a0city, resulting in appreciating real estate values.\u00a0\nInvesting in City Condos\u00a0\nInvesting in condos is an excellent strategy for passive income.\u00a0According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price of single-family homes rose 5.6% to $412,100 from April 2023, while the median sales price of condominiums increased 5.4% to $365,300.\u00a0\nThough city condos could be pricier than they are elsewhere, the fact that owners pay a maintenance fee means the public areas of the building and grounds and amenities are well maintained, saving an investor the headaches associated with single-family homes. As with other real estate types, condos appreciate while providing\u00a0cash flow\u00a0and tax breaks.\u00a0\nThe downside of condos is that because of the minimal upkeep, overseas investors often buy them in all-cash deals as a haven to park their money while living elsewhere, leaving many buildings half-occupied.\u00a0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Picture\nAccording to commercial real estate brokerage\u00a0JLL, repurposing office buildings for residential and other in-demand uses could provide a windfall for commercial real estate investors. Indeed, 90% of global real estate investors believe a former office\u2019s best\u00a0uses would be\u00a0residential assets.\u00a0\nOther uses mentioned include:\n\nIndustrial storage and data centers.\nHospitality and leisure.\nStudent or senior housing.\n\nThat said, assuming\u00a0the construction aspect of a conversion could be achieved, financial hurdles could\u00a0still\u00a0pose a problem.\n\u201cIf an office was acquired using an office-specific investment fund, pivoting to a different use often requires first selling the property and securing alternative financing,\u201d Raphaelle Bour,\u00a0lead project manager of Work Dynamics, said on the JLL website.\u00a0Noting the number of cities getting on board with tax incentives and zoning allowances, Bour added: \u201cPolicymakers are also simplifying previous conversion hurdles, hoping to reduce the number of stranded assets whose upgrade costs outweigh their worth.\u201d\nValue-Add Propositions of Older Buildings Can Offset Risk\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for investors to acquire vacant office buildings, structure the repurposing, and establish new operators,\u201d says Bour. \u201cThey can then offer assets to the market with, say, a decade of secure cash flow,\u00a0something\u00a0which is currently in high demand\u2014and many large investors are creating diversified funds for this type of operation.\u201d\nFinal Thoughts\nRepurposing office buildings offers\u00a0opportunities for both\u00a0smaller residential and more prominent\u00a0commercial investors.\u00a0For owners of small\u00a0multifamily\u00a0buildings, a big city\u2019s ongoing healthy social and financial ecosystem means a plentiful supply of tenants, the upkeep of essential services, and increasing housing values.\nFor\u00a0passive investors, the supply of new condos to the market offers the opportunity to invest in a hands-off, appreciating asset. Depending on your city\u2019s\u00a0short-term rental\u00a0rules, this asset could be used as an Airbnb, allowing you to stay in your residence when you are in town.\nFor larger-scale investors and syndications, the myriad of potential adaptive uses for older office buildings means that not only will there be financial benefits for a value-added proposition, but also the chance to choose a future-proof, in-demand business such as a data center that is not tenant-dependent and thus less risky than relying on constant upkeep, monthly rents, and high occupancy numbers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a Better Tax Strategy Now\nFind a trusted, investor-friendly tax professional who knows how to maximize real estate tax savings.\n\nFind a Tax Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote By BiggerPockets: These are opinions written by the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of BiggerPockets.\n\n"}

It\u2019s a tsunami of woe for landlords who own office and retail space and never saw it coming\u2014and it threatens the nation\u2019s entire real estate ecosystem.\u00a0\nNot only have mortgage interest rates ascended skyward, with no easing in sight, but\u00a0remote work\u00a0and e-commerce have meant former tenants have vacated buildings with no sign of return.\u00a0Big cities like New York\u00a0have\u00a0been especially hit\u00a0hard.\n\u201cYou\u00a0literally\u00a0have trillions of dollars of investment that are suddenly just massively impaired,\u201d Dan Zwirn, chief executive of Arena Investors, a New York-based asset manager and real estate investor, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal. \u201cPeople thought of these office buildings as forever because, of course,\u00a0it\u2019s going to\u00a0be 98% leased forever.\u201d\nProperty Owners Are Living on Borrowed Time\nAccording to real estate consulting firm\u00a0Colliers, the vacancy rate in U.S. commercial buildings was\u00a0at\u00a017% as of the fourth quarter of 2023, higher than it was during the financial crash of 2008. Forgiving lenders don\u2019t want to be saddled with foreclosed properties they can\u2019t sell,\u00a0and so\u00a0are holding off on court proceedings. Remaining tenants who are current with rents are holding on, allowing buildings to stay afloat\u2014for the time being.\u00a0\nHowever, without fully rented buildings, limping\u00a0along\u00a0on borrowed time means maintenance issues will mount, and finding insurance on an almost insolvent building is challenging. Many landlords who\u00a0can\u00a0see the writing on the wall have decided to cut their losses. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that many commercial buildings\u00a0around the country\u00a0are\u00a0being sold\u00a0at a 50% to 80% discount.\nAs the cycle continues, it\u2019s not just commercial landlords of skyscrapers who are feeling the pinch. Landlords and businesses throughout major cities are hurting as workers move, and municipal budgets that rely on taxes associated with valuable commercial property face shortfalls as lower property tax assessments cut revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Empty Offices Affect Cities and Small Residential Landlords\nWhen people no longer need to live in cities to work, the entire infrastructure of that city suffers, including smaller landlords who provide housing. Although the lack of inventory and high interest rates have forced people to keep renting instead of buying, it\u2019s not surprising that there has been a\u00a0huge\u00a0movement away from expensive Northern cities since the pandemic.\u00a0\nAccording to census data, New York City has been most affected, with\u00a078,000 people leaving in 2023. Overall, the state of New York lost 102,000 people. Most people leaving New York were not millionaires but the lower and middle class, earning between $32,000 and $65,000 who, without the need to\u00a0be tethered\u00a0to a costly city, were happy to give up high rents and cold weather.\nHow Empty Offices Could Impact Banks and Loans for Other Smaller Investors\nAccording to\u00a0Moody\u2019s Analytics, the national office vacancy rate reached\u00a0a record\u00a019.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\u00a0Not since\u00a01979\u00a0had offices been so empty.\u00a0\nIf landlords foreclose or sell for less than they owe, that could spell big problems for banks that hold a lot of commercial real estate debt. The aftershocks could be felt throughout the\u00a0whole\u00a0lending industry, affecting smaller landlords seeking real estate loans.\u00a0\n\u201cWe saw this play out last year: A bank gets in trouble, and that creates uncertainty in the market,\u201d Dan Roccato, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego, told\u00a0CBS. \u201cThat uncertainty ripples through the stock market, that uncertainty ripples through the real estate market, and that uncertainty then shows up in your 401(k) plan at the end of the month.\u201d\u00a0\nThe result could be cities looking to make up the tax income shortfall from distressed and discounted commercial building sales by increasing revenue from residential property or sales taxes.\nThe Waiting Game Gets Harder\n\u201cSurvive until \u201825\u201d is not a phrase any landlords struggling with high interest rates would have expected to hear at the start of the year when the Fed first touted a\u00a0series of rate cuts. However,\u00a0inflation\u2018s stubborn grip on the U.S. economy and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s steadfast position on refusing to cut rates until it falls has investors, homeowners, and many politicians\u00a0wringing their hands\u00a0in despair.\u00a0\nAs we have seen from distressed commercial real estate sales and syndications with floating-rate\u00a0mortgages, holding on to underwater debt has become increasingly difficult. Banks, too, are feeling the heat, having to carry debt expected to\u00a0be paid off. On average, commercial real estate loans make up more than a fifth of U.S. banks\u2019 overall loan portfolios. Many commercial landlords cough up borrowed cash to extend their loans until rates drop.\u00a0\nAccording to CRED iQ analysis, New York landlords SL Green and Vornado had to find around\u00a0$100 million to extend\u00a0a $1.08 billion loan on an office building at 280 Park Avenue\u00a0in April.\u00a0Other owners have decided they can no longer afford to keep servicing the debt and would do better to deploy their money elsewhere.\u00a0This\u00a0is similar to what happened in the financial crash of 2008. Waiting in vain has its limits.\n\u201cLast year, borrowers were saying, \u2018I just need three months for rate cuts to kick in,'\u201d Alex Killick, a managing director at real estate services company CWCapital Asset Management, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe aren\u2019t hearing that anymore. Powell sounded pretty clear that this is the new normal.\u201dYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nLetting properties go is always the last option for investors when the financial strain becomes unbearable. What frustrates many commercial property owners is that the Fed teased rate cuts and\u00a0then\u00a0backed off. They will inevitably happen, but when is the all-important question?\nIn the meantime, the ropes tethering commercial buildings, lenders, owners, and an entire real estate infrastructure are starting to give, threatening businesses, livelihoods, and cities.\u00a0\nAlthough no one saw the pandemic coming, the aftershocks must make politicians and landlords better prepared to handle other black swan events. At the root of it all are interest rates, fueling rampant inflation caused by the Fed\u2019s easy money policy.\nOther countries\u00a0have recovered more quickly from the pandemic than the U.S., without the inflation and rate hikes.\u00a0Lessons must be learned.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, Jerome Powell needs to offer the nation some hope. Quoting solid economic data is not enough for landlords about to lose their buildings and residents\u2019 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

New homes have since shed about 200 square feet as costs rose, urban living boomed, and families got smaller. The current affordability crisis has shrunk the envelope even more, and many real estate investors have realized that they need to downsize the square footage of their investment homes to cash flow.\nWhat Is a Tiny Home?\nBut first, what is the definition of a tiny home?\u00a0\nA tiny home is generally a dwelling that measures less than 400 square feet. Many\u00a0are constructed\u00a0on trailers, which makes them mobile. However, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and other small dwellings, such as cottages and in-law suites, can also be classified as tiny homes if they fit the rough dimensions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cost of Building a Tiny Home\nOn average,\u00a0building a tiny home costs\u00a0a minimum of\u00a0$20,000, which is around 4% of the average\u00a0U.S. home sale price.\u00a0Custom-built homes with add-ons can double the price of a tiny\u00a0home, and a\u00a0home\u00a0on wheels usually costs between $60,000 and $80,000.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if your tiny home is mobile and located in your primary residence\u2019s garden, you will not need to pay\u00a0property taxes. If it is on a foundation on a separate parcel of land, you\u00a0will need to\u00a0factor in the cost of buying the land and property taxes into your expenses.\u00a0\nROI and Cash Flow\nWith an outlay of over $100,000, what type of\u00a0cash flow\u00a0can you earn on a tiny home used for an investment? Much of it depends on your home\u2019s location. If it is by a beach in a popular tourist destination, near a lake in a picturesque countryside, or in a major city in a home\u2019s back garden, expect to earn high rents.\u00a0\nAccording to short-term rental analytics site\u00a0AirDNA, Getaway, a start-up that rents tiny prefab cabins for $129 to $299 a night, raised $41.7 million in 2021. The cost of each cabin was around $40,000 per Airbnb investment.\u00a0\nTechCrunch\u00a0revealed that Gateway experienced a nearly 100% occupancy rate for their properties. Rounding off the numbers for convenience, assuming\u00a0each home was rented\u00a0for $200/night for 300 nights per year, amounts to a total yearly income of $60,000 per year, which would pay off the cost of the cabin in its first year, with $20,000 left over for additional expenses.\u00a0\nAirbnb co-founder\u00a0Joe Gebbia started Samara in 2022, a company specializing in prefab ADUs. This further points to the growing popularity of tiny houses as investments. By placing an ADU in their backyard, homeowners can forgo the expense of real estate taxes and earn extra money without having strangers in their living space.\nCities Are Getting on Board the Tiny House Explosion\nExpensive cities see ADUs as a way to alleviate their housing crises.\u00a0Although prohibitive short-term rental laws mean\u00a0they cannot be used\u00a0in places such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York for less than 30 days, they are a much-needed housing pressure valve for conventional yearly lease tenants or\u00a0for\u00a0homeowners in need of\u00a0more space.\u00a0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADUs Could Be Great for Homeowners in Pricey Cities\nCalifornia passed a series of laws in 2016 to make ADUs\u00a0easier\u00a0to build in the state by overriding local zoning and land use restrictions, enabling backyard homes. Los Angeles also\u00a0tried to spur the construction of ADUs\u00a0by experimenting with new financing methods and other solutions. New York City will help finance the construction of ADUs under its\u00a0Plus One ADU program\u00a0with no- or low-interest loans. Although tiny homes on wheels are\u00a0illegal in New York City, ADUs, which occupy backyards on already-owned homes, are allowed.\nIt could be a fantastic way for homeowners to\u00a0bring in\u00a0extra income in a high-cost rental city.\u00a0As NYC\u2019s Housing Preservation & Development website states:\u00a0\u201cADUs can serve a number of different purposes, providing housing to family members or serving as an added source of income for household expenses by renting an additional unit.\u201d\nIn major cities, however, the cost of constructing an ADU increases dramatically compared to that of a tiny home.\u00a0For example, Samara\u2019s studio\u00a0starts at\u00a0$289,000, and the one-bedroom unit\u00a0starts at\u00a0$329,000, including installation costs.\nMultiple states\u00a0have tiny home-friendly development laws, including:\n\nCalifornia\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nKansas\nNorth Carolina\nOregon\nTexas\n\nHowever, tiny homes are illegal in the following states:\n\nAlaska\nIowa\nLouisiana\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nNorth Dakota\nWest Virginia\nWisconsin\n\nThinking Big\nIf you\u2019re thinking about instantly scaling your tiny home business, mobile home parks and trailer parks are good places to start because the grounds are already zoned for and equipped with amenities for\u00a0small\u00a0homes. It\u2019s\u00a0fairly\u00a0straightforward to buy plots of land and replace existing trailers with tiny houses, which are modern, sustainable, and more livable than trailer homes.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhether you want to\u00a0downsize your living expenses\u00a0to reach financial freedom sooner by moving into a tiny home, turbo boost your investment capital by buying tiny homes for cash, or getting lower mortgages for multiple properties, the numbers don\u2019t lie: Tiny homes are moneymakers.\u00a0\nAppreciation is often the big question leveled at tiny homes.\u00a0Clearly,\u00a0mobile tiny homes probably depreciate rather than appreciate and do not carry the same tax advantages as tiny homes\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0built\u00a0on a foundation on separate parcels of land. For the latter, as with larger homes, the same holds\u00a0true\u00a0for\u00a0tiny\u00a0homes. The more valuable the land and the greater the number of improvements you have made on your\u00a0tiny\u00a0home, the greater the appreciation will likely be.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

This year, the number of completions is set to nearly double.Institutional investors have poured large chunks of cash into build-to-rent homes. Blackstone, for example, has invested $9.5 billion into development.Most major metros are seeing record-high completions, but development is especially pronounced in Florida, Texas, and Arizona. \n\nInvestors are building single-family rental properties at an unprecedented rate, catering to a growing segment of renters seeking more space without the commitment of buying a home or the budget constraints of a high mortgage payment. A record-high 27,500 build-to-rent homes were completed in 2023, almost triple the number of completions from two years prior, according to an analysis of Yardi Matrix data from\u00a0RentCafe.\nStarter homes are in short supply. In many areas of the country, entry-level homes listed below the area median home price are scarce. Even where these smaller, no-frills homes are on the market, they might not be affordable to the typical family due to a combination of stubbornly high home prices and high mortgage rates.\u00a0\nFirst-time homebuyers have\u00a0come up with\u00a0several solutions to the\u00a0affordability\u00a0crisis, including\u00a0co-buying homes with their friends\u00a0and\u00a0living with their parents\u00a0to save for a down payment. Some are also settling for less square footage and shared walls, which has led to a boom in new\u00a0construction of\u00a0townhomes\u00a0or using the\u00a0house hacking\u00a0investment strategy to offset mortgage costs.\u00a0\nBut for other millennials, finding a single-family home with plenty of bedrooms and a backyard in a neighborhood with good schools is still a top priority\u2014even if it means they\u00a0have to\u00a0rent there. And some\u00a0remote workers\u00a0who prefer the amenities of a single-family home are choosing to rent for the freedom it provides. Therefore, demand for single-family rental homes has drawn interest from institutional investors and fueled a massive increase in the construction of homes intended for rent.\u00a0\nMore Rental Homes on the Way\nBuild-to-rent housing completions have rapidly increased since 2020, when only about 7,700 single-family rental homes\u00a0were completed. The trend will continue over the next couple of years, as more than\u00a045,400 rental properties\u00a0are currently under construction, most of which will be available for rent in 2025.\u00a0RentCafe anticipates moderation in new rental property construction in the coming years, however.\u00a0\nIn some cases, investors build single-family rental homes within communities\u00a0that have\u00a0a mix of renters and owners. But there\u2019s also been a rise in the construction of single-family rental communities.\u00a0These planned\u00a0build-to-rent communities\u00a0are neighborhoods of single-family homes, sometimes including\u00a0multifamily\u00a0units as well, all\u00a0of\u00a0which\u00a0share a common property manager and may feature community amenities such as outdoor spaces and fitness centers.\u00a0\nBuild-to-rent housing draws interest from renters who\u00a0not only\u00a0want more space, but also\u00a0the newest home features. About 41% of the country\u2019s build-to-rent houses were constructed within the last five years. A build-to-rent neighborhood holds similar appeal to a newly constructed for-sale development\u00a0while\u00a0often requiring a lower housing payment and allowing renters the freedom to move on without the hassle of selling.\u00a0\nInvestors and developers have noticed the growing demand for these communities, and institutional investment in the asset class\u00a0is poised\u00a0for growth, according to a report from\u00a0Cushman and Wakefield.\u00a0For example, over the last few years, Blackstone has poured\u00a0over $9.5 billion\u00a0cash into single-family rental property investment.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetro Areas with the Most Build-to-Rent Activity\nIn\u00a014 of the top 20 major metro areas for build-to-rent housing, the number of completed units reached a 10-year peak.\u00a0\nIn 2023, Phoenix stood out as a hotbed for build-to-rent activity, with more than 4,000 units completed. That\u2019s a 164% year-over-year increase in newly built rental properties.\u00a0The\u00a0city has a growing population and plenty of land for expansion, according to\u00a0RentCafe.\u00a0In some\u00a0high-demand coastal cities, limited space for development has prevented the build-to-rent movement from taking hold.\u00a0\nIn Dallas, almost 2,700 rental homes\u00a0were finished\u00a0in 2023, and Atlanta followed behind with\u00a0almost\u00a02,000 build-to-rent completions. Those three cities also saw the highest numbers of build-to-rent housing completed over the last five years, with a rapidly increasing availability of single-family rental properties\u00a0when\u00a0compared to 2018.\u00a0For example,\u00a0there were\u00a0only about 500 build-to-rent units available in Atlanta as of 2018.\u00a0By 2023, that number increased to over 4,000.\u00a0\nThe top five states for completed build-to-rent homes in 2023 were all in the Sunbelt:\n\nTexas:\u00a04,800 units\nArizona:\u00a04,000 units\nFlorida:\u00a02,800 units\nGeorgia:\u00a02,181 units\nSouth Carolina:\u00a01,909 units\n\nIn Texas, build-to-rent housing is\u00a0particularly popular, and new construction in cities like Dallas, Houston, and Austin will only increase the already significant supply in the coming years.\u00a0And in\u00a0Florida, new build-to-rent construction is booming across\u00a0a few different\u00a0metros.\nRentCafe also identified the other top markets with the most build-to-rent construction in progress. These metro areas have at least 1,000 new build-to-rent homes currently under construction, which are likely to be available to renters by 2026:\nMetro AreaBuild-to-Rent Units Under ConstructionPhoenix, Arizona7,236Dallas, Texas6,481Houston, Texas4,836Huntsville, Alabama2,487Charlotte, North Carolina2,426Atlanta, Georgia2,341San Antonio, Texas1,886Austin, Texas1,851Jacksonville, Florida1,836Tampa, Florida1,352Orlando, Florida1,147Salt Lake City, Utah1,141Nashville, Tennessee1,087Columbus, Ohio1,059Savannah, Georgia\u00a01,000\nInvesting in Build-to-Rent Housing\nThe current demand for single-family rental homes with modern amenities makes build-to-rent housing an attractive investment\u00a0opportunity that offers the\u00a0opportunity for stable cash flow. There are a few options for getting into the game, some with more obstacles than others:\u00a0\n\nBuild a single-family rental:\u00a0One option is to buy a plot of land in a growing area and build an ideal rental home. In some ways, this might be easier than finding a\u00a0turnkey\u00a0rental home in a supply-constrained market. But unless you can cover the construction costs from your cash reserves, you\u2019ll face unique challenges. The approval process for a\u00a0new construction loan\u00a0is often more stringent, and you may pay a higher interest rate and\u00a0greater\u00a0closing costs when compared to a traditional mortgage.\u00a0\nDevelop a rental community:\u00a0If you have a strong track record of development experience and plenty of capital, you may\u00a0find success\u00a0with a build-to-rent development, either on your own or with a team of general partners.\u00a0\nJoin a private equity fund:\u00a0Some private equity funds target build-to-rent investments. There may be a high minimum investment.

Assuming, however, that your rental is not a sprawling Beverly Hills mansion, a luxury condo in Manhattan, or, conversely, a trailer in Ohio, but rather a quality middle-class home or apartment of around 1,000 square feet in a decent neighborhood, choosing the right appliance for the home can be confusing.\u00a0\nHere are some things to bear in mind.\nCost\nThe appliances in your investment property should suit the rental price. You\u00a0are not going to\u00a0put a $100,000 La Cornue range in a $1,500-per-month rental apartment. The key to choosing the right appliance for any rental is to find one that looks stylish and works well without spending a fortune. All tenants want to see modern stainless steel (or some version of such) appliances in their homes, which means staying away from\u00a0basic\u00a0white or black appliances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Your Kitchen Around Your Range\nThe good news is that dozens of cost-efficient appliances fit these criteria. Expect to spend anywhere from $800 to $1,300 for a solid, good-looking range.\u00a0Multiple companies\u00a0offer these types of standard 30-inch ranges that fit these criteria. GE, Frigidaire, and Whirlpool are among the most popular for rentals.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0New York\u00a0Times\u2018\u00a0Wirecutter is a good, impartial place to\u00a0start researching\u00a0appliances. Although they have links to retailers and receive commissions from sales, the writers themselves\u2014to quote the\u00a0Times\u2014\u201dare never made aware of any business relationships with retailers, and products\u00a0are recommended\u00a0(or not) independent of all business and financial interests.\u201d\u00a0\nHaving written a blog for an appliance retailer in the past, I cannot say that is true for other reviews on the web. I still fondly remember the free meals in a luxury appliance manufacturer\u2019s plush Manhattan showroom\u2014not to mention the closet full of free promo materials!\nAs your range is the centerpiece of your kitchen, around which the main action occurs, I\u2019ve always found it best to choose my other appliances around it. It\u2019s also cost-effective and easy, and online stores offer appliance packages once you have\u00a0chosen\u00a0one item at deep discounts compared to buying each item individually.\nCooktop or range?\nGenerally speaking, ranges (also called stoves) are cheaper than cooktops, which sit on top of the counter and usually need slabs to\u00a0be cut\u00a0to accommodate them. Slide-in ranges are convenient, cost-effective, and easy to clean, service, and replace for rentals.\u00a0\nGas or electric?\nUnless you\u2019re renting to Gordon Ramsay (in which case, congratulations, you\u2019re rich!), having a naked flame in a rental unit is not a good idea. Electric ranges are easy to clean, present far less fire hazard, and are usually reasonably priced. Electric ranges are also better for the environment.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the world is trying to move away from fossil fuels, and\u00a0some American cities have outlawed gas ranges entirely. Regardless of where you stand politically on the issue, the tide of change is undeniable. In 10 years, electric cars will be the norm, as will fully electric homes (unless you own a wood-heated log cabin). It\u2019s best to save yourself the hassle of buying new appliances and\u00a0get with\u00a0the electric program now.\nInduction or not?\nWhen I\u00a0first\u00a0started putting induction ranges in my rental units a few years back, contractors and other investors looked at me as if I had antennae sprouting from my head.\u00a0\nInduction cooktops and ranges look and function like typical glass-top electric models, except they cook via a magnetic field. On most 30-inch induction cooktops, the field\u00a0is concentrated\u00a0into four spots (or elements).\u00a0This\u00a0means they do not emit heat like conventional electric cooktops but rather cook through a magnetic field when a pot or pan with a compliant circular pattern on the bottom (most have them)\u00a0is placed\u00a0on top.\nIt\u2019s\u00a0not as complicated as\u00a0it sounds.\u00a0They\u00a0cook like with an electric cooktop\u2014just without any heat (you can put your bare hand on an element when it is turned on and not feel a thing). However, in a country often resistant to change, they have\u00a0not taken off in the U.S.\u00a0to the same extent as they have in Europe, where their use is widespread.\u00a0\nThere are obvious advantages:\n\nSafety:\u00a0No risk of fire or burning.\u00a0This\u00a0could result in reduced insurance premiums.\nEnergy efficiency:\u00a0Induction cooking is\u00a010% more energy efficient\u00a0than conventional electric cooking.\nFast:\u00a0Waiting for a pan to heat up is not an issue, as the moment a compliant pan\u00a0is placed\u00a0on top, it cooks the food.\nEasy cleanup:\u00a0There is no danger of food getting burned on the top of the cooktop because it never gets hot.\nPeace of mind:\u00a0Landlords have one less thing to worry about since a stove fire will not happen in their rental unit.\nMake venting easier:\u00a0Since naked flames are not a risk in your kitchen, there is no need for an industrial-sized vent that looks like it belongs in a commercial kitchen.\u00a0\nYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the negative side, induction ranges are generally more expensive than conventional electric models (expect to\u00a0pay around $1,300\u00a0for a standard model that would suit mid-priced rentals). Also, some tenants might find using them takes some getting used to, and if you\u00a0are switching\u00a0from gas, rewiring your kitchen could be costly.\nWith Refrigerators, Beware of Ice Dispensers\nChoosing an applicable refrigerator\u00a0usually\u00a0comes down to kitchen space. Measure\u00a0before you buy.\nHowever, steer clear of fridge freezers with exterior ice dispensers. While these might suit a personal residence, I never use them in rentals. Tenants are not meticulous about how much ice they dispense or the cleanup when some of it lands on the floor. Despite your waterproof tile or vinyl plank flooring, excess water on the floor is never a good idea. Also, they can be prone to leaks and malfunctions and be challenging to repair.\nWasher-Dryers\nAs the world moves away from gas, your choice of dryer to accompany your washer will be limited to electric. Like stoves, many people swear against electric drying, but if\u00a0you have a choice of bringing gas lines into the house and the inherent risk they pose, along with the opportunity to future-proof your rental business, electric dryers make sense.\nRegarding the brand or size, stackable or side-by-side, there are hundreds of choices, and yours should\u00a0be based\u00a0on budget, size of the rental, and number of tenants.\u00a0I\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0get into the minutiae of\u00a0all\u00a0the configurations.\u00a0However, I will offer a few broader brush strokes of advice.\u00a0\nStay away from all-in-one washers and dryers.\u00a0They\u00a0are just\u00a0not\u00a0that\u00a0efficient\u00a0yet, particularly when it comes to drying.\u00a0 As a last resort, if you are space-challenged, you might be forced to buy one. Frankly, though, a clothes rack would prove a less frustrating experience.\nShort-Term Rentals\nIf you have\u00a0short-term rentals,\u00a0as I do,\u00a0my advice is\u00a0to\u00a0opt for a commercial-grade washer and dryer.\u00a0They might not look as fancy as residential-use ones, but with a high volume of laundry and guests who are not concerned about the upkeep of your appliances, a commercial-grade combo is the way to go.\u00a0\nSpeed Queen\u00a0has had this market locked down for decades. They are durable workhorses with\u00a0great\u00a0warranties.\u00a0\nFrigidaire and Whirlpool\nFrom my experience in the appliance business, two brands dominated the mid-range rental and flip business: Frigidaire and Whirlpool, for\u00a0the reasons I stated earlier\u2014they look good, work well, and are reasonably priced. While higher-end brands such as Miele, Bosch, and Thermador come with a certain amount of glamour and prestige, unless you have luxury rentals, it\u2019s not worth spending the money on luxury appliances.\u00a0\u00a0\nFinal Thoughts\nAppliances are often their last thought when outfitting a rental for many landlords. For tenants, appliances are often their first thought. That\u2019s why many landlords opt to buy used appliances. Used appliances can save money in the short term but prevent you from charging higher rents and not having warranties for new appliances.\u00a0\nOther things to bear in mind:\n\nCost segregation:\u00a0Under\u00a0tax law section 179, landlords may deduct the cost of appliances on their taxes.\nInclude the upkeep of new appliances in your leases:\u00a0Your\u00a0rental lease\u00a0should have a clause that lists all included appliances and stipulates any special maintenance requirements or responsibilities.\u00a0This\u00a0will hold tenants accountable for their upkeep.\nEnergy rating:\u00a0Many tenants move because of high utility bills. Low costs through energy-efficient appliances are\u00a0good\u00a0for your bottom line and the planet.\nAppliance warranties:\u00a0Choose appliances with excellent repair\u00a0warranties. You can often negotiate an extended warranty with the retailer, particularly if you have multiple rentals and offer them ongoing business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the Right Agent, Find the Right Property\nStep #1: Use Agent Finder to match with top investor-friendly real estate agents to help you find, analyze, and close your next deal.\n\nFind an Agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Today, it is a real estate success story.\u00a0\nEarly investors\u2014to quote one of Motown\u2019s most famous songs\u2014are dancing in the street. Developers are pouring billions of dollars into its business district, luring the likes of Ford, Quicken Loans, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and more to take up office space. There\u2019s even a\u00a0Gucci\u00a0store\u2014the city\u2019s first. The spillover has resulted in booming residential home prices\u2014up 40% since 2020\u2014and revitalized neighborhoods.\nVacant Buildings to Residential Space\nDetroit\u2019s tale is one that other cities such as Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco, experiencing the post-pandemic\u00a0downtown doom loop\u00a0of empty offices and increased vagrancy, could do well to emulate. A total of\u00a040-plus major construction projects\u00a0have been completed or are being completed downtown since 2018, and thanks to new construction and repurposed former vacant buildings, there will be\u00a09,567\u00a0more residential units in 2024 than in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreserving and Repurposing Historic Buildings\nIn this respect, Detroit has succeeded where other cities have failed,\u00a0in part\u00a0because many of the city\u2019s downtown office buildings are almost a century old, with small floors and stylish architecture that convert well into residential buildings\u2014unlike the 1970s and \u201980s glassy towers in other cities.\u00a0\nSpearheading this conversion is Dan Gilbert, a Detroit native and the billionaire co-founder of home lender Rocket Mortgage. This pioneer moved his company to downtown from the suburbs in 2010. He told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal, \u201cWe\u00a0really\u00a0had three options: Extend the leases, go to some farmland and build a campus\u2014which wasn\u2019t\u00a0really\u00a0attractive to us\u2014or come downtown and fill up some of these beautiful old buildings that we\u00a0really\u00a0loved.\u201d\nMaking Downtown a Destination for More Than Work\nGilbert\u2019s companies bought\u00a0more than\u00a0130 properties downtown, spending billions on revitalizing the city and encouraging other companies to take advantage of cheap office space in gorgeous buildings. Ford Motor Company, always synonymous with the city, is spending $900 million to redevelop Michigan Central, the city\u2019s abandoned train station\u2014opening in June\u2014and surrounding properties. Start-ups are streaming in.\u00a0\nHowever, to make Downtown less office-dependent, casinos, sports venues, and revamped aging theaters have added a vibrant nightlife appeal. Developers have responded to generous tax breaks to build, and the knock-on effect has been increased condo and apartment prices.\n\u201cBest Investment in America\u201d\nResidential property values in the city climbed an average of\u00a023% last year, marking the seventh straight year of growth. Values rose 31% in 2022 and 8% per neighborhood from 2021 numbers. In total, all 208 of the city\u2019s neighborhoods saw increases.\nMayor Mike Duggan gleefully called the city the \u201cbest investment in America.\u201d Some neighborhoods, such as Campau/Banglatown, New Center Commons, DelRay, and Carbon Works,\u00a0saw their values increase\u00a0by more than 50%. A strategic plan to keep\u00a0real estate taxes\u00a0low has helped.\n\u201cSince 2018, Detroit property values have exploded, not your tax rate,\u201d Duggan said in a statement. \u201cIt stayed down here, and today, the average Detroiter is\u00a0being taxed\u00a0at half their assessed value.\u201d\nA Haven for House Flippers\nAs such, in recent years, Detroit has been a haven for\u00a0house flippers\u00a0and new residents. Duggan said about 15,000 homes, as well as parks, streetscapes, and streetlights, saw improvements. He also mentioned the Detroit Land Bank\u2019s declining inventory, which has gone from 45,000 abandoned homes in 2014 to less than 5,000 today.\nToday, Detroit remains\u00a0extremely\u00a0affordable.\u00a0According to\u00a0Realtor.com,\u00a0the median listing home price is $89,900, and the median sold home price is $79,000.\u00a0Although the current 4,236 homes for sale cover a wide range of prices\u2014everywhere from $750 for a lot to $8.6 million for a 36,000-square-foot\u00a0multifamily\u00a0property\u2014investing and raising a family in a decent Detroit neighborhood is\u00a0extremely\u00a0achievable.\nRents have also increased in the city, making it\u00a0a\u00a0profitable\u00a0place\u00a0for out-of-town landlords to invest.\u00a0They often\u00a0buy houses for cash. The\u00a0same amount of money would only pay for a\u00a0down payment\u00a0elsewhere.\u00a0\n\u201cMarket sales are 58%, and distress[ed] sales are about 42%,\u201d City Councilman Coleman A. Young II told the\u00a0Detroit News. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the first times that we\u2019ve had more market sales than distress[ed] sales in\u00a0the city of\u00a0Detroit.\u201d In 2013, 90% of Detroit\u2019s homes were sold for cash, as borrowers could not obtain a mortgage.\u00a0You might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut There Are Still Issues\nDespite the massive new development and rising house prices, investing in a Detroit fixer-upper is far from a cakewalk, as this\u00a0New York Times article\u00a0reveals.\u00a0Finding a quality, honest contractor\u00a0can still be\u00a0tough, and\u00a0nefarious\u00a0characters are around, ready to steal tools and worse. \u201cWelcome to Detroit\u201d is a phrase often used by jaded police officers when out-of-state investors fall victim to crime.\u00a0\nAll this means that out-of-town investors still have to pick and choose neighborhoods to buy in carefully, and having the help of\u00a0knowledgeable real estate investors\u00a0and property managers in the area is a huge benefit.\u00a0\nOther Cities Like Detroit Where Investment Makes Sense\nIt\u2019s hard to find cities like Detroit, where house prices\u00a0are\u00a0still\u00a0incredibly low,\u00a0and\u00a0yet tremendous development and appreciation have occurred.\u00a0That\u2019s because Detroit scratched its way up from bankruptcy when the loose change in your pocket could have bought you a home there a decade ago.\u00a0\nOther\u00a0major\u00a0cities experiencing downtown problems\u00a0are\u00a0still\u00a0too\u00a0expensive to invest in, whereas other\u00a0affordable Midwestern cities, such as Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Cleveland, have been\u00a0losing workers\u00a0in their downtowns, resulting in a loss of residents.\u00a0\nHowever,\u00a0several Midwestern cities, such as Canton and Akron, Ohio; Omaha, Nebraska; and Springfield, Missouri, have emulated Detroit, reinventing themselves with new businesses and attracting new residents. These cities are ripe for investment.\u00a0Beginning the investment journey here means comparing house\u00a0prices,\u00a0rental\u00a0rates,\u00a0and talking to real estate agents and property managers.\nFinal Thoughts\u00a0\nAs an experienced investor, I have learned that the bodybuilding adage of \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d also holds\u00a0true\u00a0for real estate. To achieve the best returns, you have to\u00a0be prepared\u00a0to endure a degree of discomfort.\u00a0Riding\u00a0an equity/appreciation wave as a city transitions from bad times to\u00a0good\u00a0means catching the wave during the dark days and all the ills that come with it.\nEarly pioneers who invested in Detroit 15 years ago undoubtedly have their war stories but are sitting pretty today. However, the house prices are still low enough that investing here\u00a0still\u00a0makes sense.\nLooking at the projects planned for a city\u2019s downtown area can often indicate how the surrounding areas will operate: What new businesses are moving in? Are they future-proof? What are the development plans? Are there new coffee shops, art galleries, and artists in the neighborhoods? Are residents arriving rather than leaving?\u00a0\nThese are the early signs of any city on the move. Making a downtown livable and a place to congregate safely outside work hours is another\u00a0strong\u00a0sign.\u00a0So far, Detroit\u00a0seems to have\u00a0checked all the boxes.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

Let\u2019s Reevaluate in an Era of High Interest Rates\n\n\nContent: \n\n\n\n\nIn This Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor real estate investors, the question of cash flow versus appreciation is as old as time.\u00a0However, in an\u00a0era of\u00a0high interest\u00a0rates, buying properties for cash flow\u00a0isn\u2019t easy.\u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean investing should be off the table, as there are many advantages of owning rentals other than immediate cash flow\u2014appreciation and tax advantages being the most obvious.\u00a0\nWhether to keep buying or stay\u00a0on the sidelines comes down to some specific decisions.\u00a0Let\u2019s dig deeper.\nThe Higher the Cash Flow, the Greater the Headaches\nThe less expensive the property, the greater the cash flow. That\u2019s the theory, anyway. Rentals in low-income neighborhoods might cost less, but tenants also earn less and cannot withstand the financial hurdles that life throws\u00a0at\u00a0them. Thus, potential cash flow numbers\u00a0are rarely achieved\u00a0due to vacancies, repairs, and evictions.\u00a0\nBuying multiple doors in C or D+ neighborhoods has the potential to turn into one big headache.\u00a0This\u00a0was exposed during the pandemic when most tenants seeking a pause in rental payments and an\u00a0eviction moratorium\u00a0were from\u00a0lower-income areas. The landlords greatest affected were smaller mom-and-pop owners who fell behind on mortgage payments, ruing the day they chose to invest where they did.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Section 8 Caveat\nSome might champion Section 8 rentals, but the hurdles of dealing with Section 8 inspectors and hoping your tenants maintain your property often make the experience hard for investors who got into real estate to lessen life\u2019s stresses rather than add to them.\u00a0\nHowever, with interest rates higher than\u00a0they have been\u00a0in years, the only places to cash flow are likely cheaper properties in lower-income neighborhoods.\u00a0Many successful landlords are in these areas, but it is\u00a0not\u00a0a\u00a0passive\u00a0venture.\u00a0Stabilizing buildings and maintaining repairs and rents is a full-time, labor-intensive endeavor.\nParking Your Cash for Appreciation and Tax Benefits\nNot needing cash flow is the enviable position many investors want to get to because it means you are already financially free. According to CoreLogic\u2019s U.S. Home Price Insights, nationwide,\u00a0prices increased by 5.5%\u00a0year over year as of December 2023.\u00a0This\u00a0coincides with a healthy job market, wage growth, and lowered inflation.\nUsing a 5% metric, if you own an investment property valued at $200,000, your home would have appreciated\u00a0by\u00a0around $10,000 in one year. That\u2019s the equivalent of cash flowing just under $1,000/month. In the current interest rate climate, that\u2019s a tough ask.\nIf you own $2 million worth of real estate, you would have increased your net worth by $100,000. Added to this are the\u00a0tax benefits\u00a0of\u00a0depreciation, repair, and operating expenses associated with real estate, which means even if you are not cash-flowing, you are still building wealth.\u00a0Refinancing\u00a0will add cash flow to the equation when rates eventually drop.\u00a0\nBetter Neighborhoods Equals Lower Cash Flow\nThe problem with investing in highly appreciating areas is that they generally\u00a0do not\u00a0cash flow\u00a0well\u00a0because they are more expensive.\u00a0However, when factored against tenant issues in lower-income neighborhoods, holding on to a good asset in a more upscale neighborhood is likely\u00a0to be\u00a0more beneficial in appreciation, even if it only pays for itself. The cash flow will also increase once the asset\u00a0is paid down\u00a0and the rents\u00a0increase.\nThe Case for Cash Flow\nMany\u00a0syndicators\u00a0utilize the strategy of forcing appreciation through value-added improvements that increase cash flow to attract investors who would otherwise be unwilling to invest.\n\u201cWe never invest for\u00a0appreciation,\u00a0since that is out of our control,\u201d Tyler Cauble of\u00a0The Cauble Group, a commercial real estate investor and consultant, told\u00a0bestevercre.com. \u201cOur team selects projects where we can create value and force appreciation through value-add or development from scratch. Any appreciation is just icing on top.\u201d\nJonathan Barr of\u00a0JB2 Investments, a multifamily syndicator, concurred: \u201cI would say: Always invest for cash flow\u2014but inevitably, increased positive cash flow\u00a0is followed\u00a0by appreciation.\u201d\nGrant Cardone is one of the most voluble proponents of the cash flow model. On\u00a0gctv.com, he poses the cash flow versus appreciation question\u2014and answers it this way:\n\u201cWhenever someone asks me if cash flow or appreciation is better when investing in real estate, I\u00a0give them a dumbfounded look\u00a0because they should already know the answer.\u00a0Cash flow investments provide a regular stream of income. In contrast, appreciation investments offer the potential for a more significant return if the investment is sold at a higher price than the purchase price. Getting wealthy from real estate investments is possible. You\u00a0have to\u00a0focus on cash flow, and the market fluctuation won\u2019t affect you as much.\u201dYou might also likeReal Estate TrendsAirbnb Is Pairing Up With Mom-and-Pop Investors to Win Its War\u2014but Is It Too Late?Real Estate TrendsZero-Down Mortgages Are Making a Comeback\u2014Is This the Beginning of Another Housing Crash?Real Estate Trends14 Cities With the Highest Risk of Storm Damage This Hurricane Season\u2014How Can You Protect Your Property?Real Estate TrendsData-Backed Solutions: Addressing the Top Real Estate Challenges of 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs It Possible to Cash Flow Without Giving Your Money to a Syndicator?\nDespite what most syndicator salespeople might claim, handing your cash over to them should require first knowing the details of their financing. Without this knowledge, you are taking a leap of faith. In an era of fluctuating interest rates, only long-term financing attained before the rise in rates can insulate an operator against financial difficulties.\u00a0\nIf you want to maintain autonomy and cash flow on your investment properties, here are some steps to take:\n\nBuy under-market properties that need work, complete the work, and increase rents.\nMake a\u00a0large\u00a0down payment\u00a0to ensure the home cash flows, and refinance once rates drop.\nAdd bedrooms by converting attics and larger rooms to increase cash flow.\nRent by the room to add rental income.\nUse your property as a\u00a0short-term rental, if possible.\u00a0According to AirDNA, STRs generate\u00a061% more income\u00a0than regular rentals. The STR market\u00a0continues to grow\u00a0despite higher interest rates, as lower inflation has increased travel, AirDNA says.\nSecure noninstitutional financing from a family member at a lower rate.\nEnter into a\u00a0subject-to-agreement\u00a0with the current owner, keep the current mortgage in place, and refinance them out of the property when rates drop.\nLiquidate other assets to buy the home for cash at a discounted price and refinance when rates drop.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nInterest rates are the differentiator in the cash flow versus appreciation argument. Although many syndicators and gurus might preach that \u201ccash flow is king,\u201d with rates unlikely to drop substantially in a robust economy, a more nuanced approach could be beneficial\u2014if you can afford it.\u00a0\nIf you are not in a rush to quit your job and can afford to ride out high rates, buying for appreciation and tax advantages while waiting for a refinance to cash flow later could be wise. There\u2019s little doubt that prices will soar as rates drop.\u00a0\nHowever, if you don\u2019t have cash reserves and must find a cash-flowing investment, you\u2019ll need to make a risk-versus-reward decision. Hitching your financial wagon to a syndicator without the requisite research is\u00a0a risk. Implementing some of the strategies mentioned here could work. Also, waiting until you are in a better financial position to invest could be prudent.\nAs an experienced investor who enjoys their job (I write for BiggerPockets!), I have taken the somewhat uncomfortable move of stocking up on real estate in solid B/B+ neighborhoods, leveraging myself\u00a0in a way\u00a0that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise others, taking the tax breaks over cash flow, and waiting for rates to fall. It\u2019s a long-term approach that I have watched other investors successfully employ. It\u2019s not for everyone, but having endured wipeouts\u00a0previously, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the value of holding solid assets in good areas. Cash flow is\u00a0wonderful, but to expect it overnight is, I\u2019ve discovered, often wishful thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Best Loan Today\nFind trusted, investor-friendly lenders who specialize in your strategy. \n\n\nFind a Lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the community\nReady to succeed in real estate investing?

People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don\u2019t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \nHave high rates caused property values to decline?\nThere are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \nWe have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \n\nHigh rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \n\n\n\nShould you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\nI think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \nHere are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\n\nDoes the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn\u2019t mean that properties can\u2019t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \nWhat kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \nCan you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \nDo you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don\u2019t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn\u2019t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \nAre you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \n\nWill rates go down allowing a refinance?\nI believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \nNo one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \nConclusion\nIf you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 thoughts on \u201cShould you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n PS Group says: \n\nOctober 25, 2023 at 1:21 am \n\n\nVery useful advice!

I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \n\n\n\nShould you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\nI think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \nHere are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\n\nDoes the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn\u2019t mean that properties can\u2019t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \nWhat kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \nCan you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \nDo you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don\u2019t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn\u2019t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \nAre you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \n\nWill rates go down allowing a refinance?\nI believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \nNo one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \nConclusion\nIf you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 thoughts on \u201cShould you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n PS Group says: \n\nOctober 25, 2023 at 1:21 am \n\n\nVery useful advice!

People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don\u2019t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \nHave high rates caused property values to decline?\nThere are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \nWe have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \n\nHigh rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building.

What are the responsibilities of a property manager?\nRead on if you are contemplating pursuing a property management career. We hope the list of responsibilities below will help you decide if this career is for you.\nWhat Does a Property Manager Do?\nIn general, a property manager is hired when the landlord or real estate investor wants to outsource some or all of the daily responsibilities of their rental property. Property manager responsibilities can, indeed, include a few basic tasks or you might be responsible for entire operations at the property. We list below 10 common property manager responsibilities.\n1. Finding New Tenants\nProperty manager responsibilities usually include tenant management. This is the main responsibility of landlords and many are happy to outsource this to property managers. Tenant management often includes finding and attracting tenants. Residential property managers are expected to fill vacant rental units at the property. Marketing a rental property, therefore, is part of the job description. They will need to advertise the rentals and post compelling ads to relevant listing sites and other places for advertising rentals.\n2. Tenant Screening\nProperty manager responsibilities also include making sure that new prospective tenants are trustworthy. Here, professional property managers often have a specific tenant screening process that goes through the prospective tenants\u2019 credit history and backgrounds. The good thing here is that the more people they screen over time, the better and faster they can pick the right tenants and avoid frequent tenant turnover.\n3. Handling Complaints\nMaintenance and\u00a0handling complaints are also common property management responsibilities. For example, if someone is having frequent parties at the property and the neighbors complain about it, it will likely be the property manager who will have to deal with it. Sometimes property managers even have to handle emergency situations, so you should also be aware of the safety precautions taken at the property.\n4. Coordinating Tenant Turnover\nProperty manager responsibilities include the coordination of tenant turnover. Indeed, property managers are the ones who need to coordinate when people move in and out. Property managers will need to check the rental spaces after previous tenants for damages, organize cleaning, and fix any damages before new tenants move in.\nIn some cases where tenants cause problems, the property manager handles the evictions. This means they should know the landlord-tenant laws as well as have the courage to handle the situation confidently.\n5. Setting, Collecting, and Adjusting Rents\nCollecting rent is a basic responsibility of any landlord. Property manager responsibilities, therefore, can also include lease management as this task landlords gladly outsource to property managers. The property manager will also usually define and set up systems for collecting rent from tenants. They will often have to include strict deadlines and penalties for late payments, and a method to check all rents have been paid as agreed.\nThe property manager is not only in charge of collecting the rents but is also usually responsible for setting a rental rate. This requires that they actually know the market. A property manager must adjust the rents in a way that attracts tenants but also generates rental income for the owners. Likewise, the property manager can\u00a0also increase or lower rent\u00a0annually based on the developments in the real estate market.\n6. Property Maintenance\n\nProperty manager responsibilities also include property maintenance. This will ensure the property stays in good condition and is a safe environment for the tenants. Maintenance means investigating and resolving tenant complaints and enforcing rules of occupancy. They will also check all the vacant apartments and maintain and renovate them as needed or coordinate the work of contractors. Do note that in colder locations, basic maintenance can even include contracting snow removal services.\n7. Securing the Property\nProperty manager responsibilities often go beyond basic maintenance at the rental property. They will also need to secure the property by either contracting security guards or maintaining proper security devices or both. Their role will also include setting up policies and procedures that build emergency preparedness. A professional property manager knows that the more secure the rental property is, the more sense of security the tenants feel. This improves tenant retention.\n8. Overall Supervision \nThe responsibilities of a property manager and their role can often be a lot more than meets the eye. Yes, property manager responsibilities do include the more visible day-to-day errands and services, but in the background, they can, in fact, run the entire show. That is if the real estate investor wants to utilize the whole spectrum of property management support available out there. Property managers can be requested to carry out all the analysis, planning, and management of the property. To this end, they do need a wide set of management skills and knowledge of the real estate domain.\nIf there are other employees working in the rental property, for example, security guards, property manager duties include supervising their work. This includes setting their salaries and evaluating their performance. Property managers will also supervise other potential contractors at the property.\n9. Financial Management\nFor a residential property manager, financial management starts from analyzing and establishing the right rental rates, calculating costs, depreciation, and taxes as well as determining realistic profit goals and a budget to achieve them. On top of planning, a property manager is also expected to accomplish financial objectives. To this end, they collect rents and pay invoices, monitor variances, and take corrective action to get the budget back on track.\n10. Staying Up-to-Date and Enforcing Landlord-Tenant Laws\nProfessional property managers must have in-depth knowledge of local landlord-tenant laws in terms of screening tenants, handling security deposits, lease terminations, and evictions, as well as compliance with property safety standards. They will have to enforce these and all the policies laid out in the lease contracts. This can also include confronting potential violators.\nFinal Thoughts\nWe hope this list of common property manager responsibilities provided you a better understanding of what is expected of this role. As you probably noticed, property manager responsibilities can include only a few essential tasks or include entire management of the rental property. It is safe to say that property managers need to acquire various skills and knowledge for managing rental properties successfully.

If you want to work in the real estate industry, this job is a good way to start.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that apartment rentals are a big part of the real estate industry. Because there will always be a demand for rental properties, you will also have an easier time finding a job in this field. The one role that can get you started is a leasing agent job.\n\n\nSimilar to real estate agents, leasing agents help people find properties to rent, handle all of the paperwork involving the lease, and provide customer service. But unlike real estate agents, they usually work for one leasing company or one apartment complex. And because they are always present in the residential area where they work, leasing agents often have to build rapport with the residents and offer personalized service.\n\n\nIn this article, you will read everything there is to know about becoming a leasing agent, including:\n\n\n\nWhat a leasing agent does\nHow much does a leasing agent earn\nPerks of a leasing agent job\nThe pros and cons of being a leasing agent\nHow to become a leasing agent\n\n\n\nWhat a Leasing Agent Does\n\n\nThe leasing agent profession is a junior role that can grow into a full-blown real estate career. Property management firms and corporate apartment complexes are often hiring leasing agents who deal with potential new tenants who inquire about a unit. An ideal leasing agent has the following qualities:\n\n\n\nFriendly\nResponsive\nOrganized\nA good judge of character\n\n\n\nAside from touring prospective renters, they must also make sure to get quality tenants who would make great long-term residents and pay their rent on time.\n\n\nA leasing agent often works for one company or building, but there are some who work as leasing specialists in real estate agencies who act like real estate agents. They work on commission and do not represent the properties that they are showing. They also prioritize making money for themselves.\n\n\nThose who are stressed out from the hustle of working as a real estate agent but would like to stay in the industry might be curious about the pros and cons of being a leasing agent. Those who want to start their career in real estate but do not want to be a real estate agent can also consider applying for this job.\n\n\nHow Much Does a Leasing Agent Make?\n\n\nThe main difference between a leasing agent and a real estate agent is how much they make. A real estate agent gets paid on a commission basis. The amount they earn is usually around 5% to 6% depending on where they work.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a leasing agent is paid a salary. Their starting pay is around $12 to $17 per hour or $30,000 per year, according to Glassdoor. But as you climb the career ladder and earn bonuses, your annual salary could climb to $75,000 or more, depending on where you work.\n\n\nHere is a sample leasing professional job description at the entry level:\n\n\n\nAnswering inquiries over phone and email\nSetting appointments to view available units\nShowing apartments to prospective tenants\nCollecting lease applications\n\n\n\nOne of the pros and cons of being a leasing agent is that from the start, it looks like a standard 9-5 job. But as you gain more experience, you may be able to take on more responsibilities like:\n\n\n\nHandling the marketing and social media\nMaintaining relationships with brokers\nProcessing lease applications\nRunning background and credit checks\nProcessing lease paperwork and deposits\nSupervising move-ins and move-outs\n\n\n\nPerks of Being a Leasing Agent\n\n\nThe perks of working as a leasing agent may vary depending on the company and state. They may not get to live rent-free, but they could get reduced rent as part of their compensation. Some employers also offer incentives like one-month free rent whenever they reach their monthly target. Other benefits they may enjoy include:\n\n\n\nFuel discount\nPaid time off\nFamily leave\nVision insurance\nDental insurance\nHealth insurance\nLife insurance\nDisability insurance\nReferral program\n401(k)\n401(k) matching\n\n\n\nAside from these, the pros and cons of being a leasing agent involve the job itself. If you are a people person, you will get to interact with many people when showing the apartments. Because prospective renters may come from all walks of life, you will get to meet people from different backgrounds and may get to hear interesting stories.\n\n\nWhile the job sounds like a standard 9-5 gig, you do not have to sit at your desk all day. You may have to go help potential and current tenants with their concerns. Every day will be filled with a challenge for you to solve. If you do not like having a predictable schedule, maybe working as a leasing agent is for you.\n\n\nPros and Cons of Being a Leasing Agent\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in applying to become a leasing agent but are not sure what to expect, here are six major pros about this role:\n\n\nPro: A Lot of In-Person Interactions\n\n\nWhen you start working as a leasing agent, two of your main responsibilities involve responding to inquiries over the phone and email and touring prospective tenants to available apartments. So you can expect to talk to not just your co-workers, but also with people who are interested in renting the apartment where you are working.\n\n\nPro: Nice Working Environment\n\n\nBecause of your role in touring prospective tenants, your desk is usually at the front office. Depending on where you work, your desk might be facing beautiful landscaping, which can be relaxing to look at when you need to take a quick break.\n\n\nPro: Guaranteed Compensation\n\n\nUnlike a real estate agent who only earns from commissions, a leasing agent earns an hourly wage plus sales commissions. So the amount of money you work is relative to how hard you work. The better your sales skills are, the better you will be at leasing apartments and therefore earning commissions and bonuses.\n\n\nPro: Reduced Rent\n\n\nAs part of your compensation package, your employer could also let you rent an apartment where you work and pay a reduced fee. They may also offer you incentives like one-month free rent when you sign a certain number of leases in that period. Even if your employer gives you a few hundred dollars discount, you can use those savings on other important things.\n\n\nPro: College Education or Specialized Training Is Not Always Necessary\n\n\nSome employers may not require a college degree for you to work as a leasing agent, especially if it is an entry-level role. Instead, they are looking for sales skills and work experience in interacting with people on a regular basis. You must also be friendly and have a can-do attitude.\n\n\nPro: Can Be a Part-Time Job\n\n\nIf you are just looking for a second job and are willing to come in during the evenings and weekends, you might be able to work part-time as a leasing agent.\n\n\nGiven how competitive rentals can be, leasing companies would want to be available for tours and signing as much as possible. And usually, prospective tenants would want to look at apartments when they are off work. So you will still be busy during these short periods, but you are also likely to sign new leases.\n\n\nOf course, there are cons to doing this job as well.\n\n\nCon: In-Person Interaction Can Be Stressful\n\n\nBeing a leasing agent is a customer service role, so aside from meeting people from different backgrounds, you will also encounter people with different personalities. Not all of them will be nice. Some can be demanding, and a few might just be downright mean. Remember to stay level-headed when dealing with difficult people and learn when to escalate an issue to your supervisor.\n\n\nCon: You Need to Respond to Inquiries Immediately\n\n\nRental properties are always in high demand and can be competitive. As the person in charge of answering phone and email inquiries from prospective tenants, you need to be on top of your response time. This might require you to reply to messages even during your lunch break, but doing this can help you get closer to reaching your targets.\n\n\nCon: Low Base Pay\n\n\nDepending on where you want to work and how much experience you have, you might start working with low hourly pay. But if you calculate your entire compensation package, which may also include commissions, performance bonuses, reduced rent, etc., you might end up earning more. You just have to do a great job.\n\n\nCon: Need to Be On-Site to Greet Walk-In Prospects and Give Tours\n\n\nUnlike real estate agents who may work from anywhere, leasing agents must be at the apartment complex to show prospective tenants to available units. This might not be appealing to those who would want to work remotely, but it is perfect for those who are not into traveling around for work.\n\n\nCon: A Lot of Standing and Walking Around the Apartment Complex\n\n\nBecause you will be giving tours to prospects and helping current tenants, you will not be at your desk all day. In fact, there might be times when you will be going around the complex a lot. Make sure that you wear comfortable clothing and footwear so you do not end your day having sore feet.\n\n\nCon: Working Evenings and Weekends Are Often Required\n\n\nUnless your employer hires a part-time agent to take over during the evenings and weekends, you might have to work outside of your usual 9-5 schedule. This may happen if a prospect schedules an appointment outside of your work hours, or if you have to help a resident move into or move out of their apartment during the weekend.\n\n\nHow to Become a Leasing Agent\n\n\nIf you still want to try this out after learning about the pros and cons of being a leasing agent, here is how you can be one.\n\n\nYou do not need to have any special training or degree to become a leasing agent, though some companies may have more strict requirements. If you want to take this job as a way to enter the real estate industry, you can look for part-time or support-level roles where you will be working with more experienced agents.\n\n\nOnce you start working, though, you will get on-the-job training to learn about the tech, skills, and systems that you need for your role. And if your boss thinks that you are ready to move up the ladder, they may encourage you to undergo some specialized training and even become certified. To qualify for a managerial role, you must first need to be certified by the National Apartment Association.\n\n\nKickstart Your Real Estate Career\n\n\nBecoming a leasing agent is a great way to test whether the real estate industry is for you. You will be working for a leasing company or apartment complex, and you will spend the day talking with prospective tenants and current residents.

These types of listings should never be overlooked by any broker or agent for the potential they bring.\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Are Expired Listings, and Why Are They Important?\nGet Expired Listings on the MLS\nCheck Public Records\nConsult Other Real Estate Agents\nBuy Expired Listing Leads\nUse Social Media Ads for Marketing to Expired Listings\nCreate and Share Videos That Speak to Expired Listing Leads\nCreate an Expired Listings Script\nCreate a Template for an Expired Listings Letter\nCall Expired Listing Owners Directly\nCreate and Automate Drip Marketing Campaigns\nNext Steps\n\nThe thing about expired listings is that they offer several benefits to you as an agent, such as:\n\nThey have higher conversion rates from lead to client. Estimates say that agents often get one appointment for every 25 contacted expired listings. This gives them a better conversion rate of 4% compared to ordinary listings.\nThey lead you to more motivated sellers. Expired listings typically bring along with them highly motivated sellers who are a lot easier to work with.\nThey give you a more affordable lead generation strategy. Typically, lead generation costs plenty of money, whether you buy lists or pay for marketing and promotion. In contrast, expired listings are virtually free. You just need to know how to find them.\nThey aren\u2019t as labor-intensive. Relisting expired listings takes far less effort than working with buyers.\nThe seller is more likely eager to work with a new agent. If the previous agent didn\u2019t get the job done, the seller will be more willing to work with a new agent.\n\nCurious now? Read for more.\nWhat Are Expired Listings, and Why Are They Important?\n\nAn expired listing is a property that hasn\u2019t been sold by the end of a certain agreed-upon period between a seller and a listing agent.\nWhen people are getting their property listed for sale, they usually enter an agreement with a real estate agent that the home will be listed for a specific duration (like six months). However, the property might end up not getting sold within that period.\nIf the listing is not renewed, it becomes an expired listing. Real estate listings expire due to reasons such as overpriced homes, inexperienced real estate agents, poor staging, an oversupply of similar homes, and poor real estate marketing.\nExpired listings are a great source of quality leads for top real estate agents. Since property owners are motivated to sell, realtors can negotiate a good price and close quickly. However, the first thing you need to do as an agent is learn how to find expired listings.\nThe good news is that prospecting expired listings is a low-overhead, low-cost business strategy. In addition, this type of listing has been proven to have higher conversion ratios compared to other prospecting methods.\nAside from door knocking and cold calling, there are other strategic methods for successful real estate lead generation. We have listed seven effective ways of finding expired real estate listings in 2023. Let\u2019s go over each of them real quick.\nExpired Listings Versus Withdrawn and Canceled Listings\nAside from \u201cexpired\u201d, you might also see listings that are either \u201cwithdrawn\u201d or \u201ccanceled\u201d. How do these two differ from expired listings?\nA withdrawn listing occurs when the seller decides to temporarily remove their property from the market. Under this status, the listing contract remains in place; it\u2019s just not properly marketed or shown to potential buyers. Sellers might withdraw their listings for different reasons, such as needing to make repairs, personal reasons, or reevaluating their selling strategy. Unlike expired listings, withdrawn listings can be reactivated without renegotiating the listing agreement, and the property can return to active status when the seller is ready.\nMeanwhile, a canceled listing means that the listing agreement between the seller and their real estate agent has been terminated before the expiration date. This can happen if the seller no longer wishes to sell their property, is not satisfied with their agent\u2019s performance, or wants to switch agents. Once a listing is canceled, the property is no longer on the market under that specific contract, and the seller is free to enter into a new agreement with a different agent or not re-list at all.\n1. Get Expired Listings on the MLS\nMany hot real estate agents use the MLS for real estate lead generation by looking for listings that are due to expire in less than a month. To find expired MLS listings, all you need to do is go to your MLS dashboard and select locations that you want to search by town or city.\nNext, enter the expiration date of your search (four weeks or less) to identify listings that will expire soon. Once you have identified some soon-to-expire properties, figure out a way to get in touch with the seller and find out if they would want to relist their home with a new agent. Of course, be sure not to get in touch with the seller until the day after the listing has expired.\nStill, with this strategy, you can be one of the first agents who makes contact. Just keep in mind that perusing through the MLS for expired listings can be a very time-consuming and stressful task.\nIf you simply don\u2019t have the patience and resolve to do this, there are other ways that you can find expired listings online or offline. That\u2019s what this list is all about. We will go through other simple yet practical and effective strategies for you to find what you\u2019re looking for.\nIn the meantime, we would advise you not to neglect this particular strategy, as it is one of the most effective ways of getting the leads you need.\n2. Check Public Records\nJust like going over the multiple listing service, searching through public records is another effective but time-consuming method of finding expired listing leads.\nWhat makes this extra challenging is it will require visiting your location\u2019s record archive, such as the county courthouse or city hall, and requesting access to listing records. Please note that it can take hours to flip through online lists or paper documents before getting one lead. That is on top of the commute time you will need to get to your local record office.\nDespite that, this particular method has a very good upside. Though this real estate lead generation method is very time-consuming, it is free and can be a source of valuable information about a home and its current owner.\nOn top of the typical info such as names and phone numbers, you can confirm details such as:\n\nDivorce proceedings\nPurchase price history\nTime on market\nEstate references\n\nThese, and other similarly useful information, could help you get that lead you\u2019re looking for. This particular method may require a bit more effort on your part but should also not be overlooked.\n3. Consult Other Real Estate Agents\n\nIn the world of business, especially real estate, your connections and networks matter. You need to take care of those relationships, especially if you\u2019re learning how to be a more effective agent. These connections could give you good leads to business opportunities you wouldn\u2019t have all by yourself.\nAt times, real estate agents in your network will have several expired listings that they are open to sharing for a commission or fee. Others would be willing to do a kind of exchange to receive other valuable listings. This is why you need to stay in touch with other agents in your area to grow your real estate business.\nTake phone numbers and email addresses. Exchange business cards with them. Send them postcards once in a while to show you remember them. This way, they also don\u2019t forget about you when they come across expired listings in your area.\nSo make sure to take care of those relationships. You don\u2019t need to be best friends with each of them. You just need to ensure that you have a good professional relationship with them.\nConduct your affairs and services with dignity and integrity always. This will increase people\u2019s confidence in you that will make them give you good leads without hesitation because of your professionalism and reputation.\u00a0 That\u2019s how you grow your network.\n4. Buy Expired Listing Leads\nAn efficient and cost-effective strategy for real estate lead generation is to simply buy the information you need. Though many real estate agents might not like the idea of buying expired listings, it saves you the trouble of having to scrape for information from the MLS and public records.\nThere are several platforms online where you can purchase expired leads based on parameters such as property type, your target housing market, and your goals as a real estate agent. You only need to identify which sites make for the best sources for this type of information.\nOf course, you will have to take into account the quality of data the platform provides, so choose wisely.\nOnce you find a platform that you believe offers you high-quality data and reliable information, you can look for expired listings to buy. Just make sure to perform due diligence before making any purchases so you get your money\u2019s worth.\n5. Use Social Media Ads for Marketing to Expired Listings\nYou can use social media ads to promote yourself as a real estate agent and encourage owners to relist with you.\nSince you are marketing your services, be sure to mention properties that you have sold in difficult-to-sell areas or slow buying seasons in your social media ads. Use hashtags such as #expiredlistings to attract the right audience and offer complimentary reports such as home valuations.\nFor more accurate targeting when generating real estate leads, we suggest using Facebook ads. Since almost everyone is on Facebook, advertising on the social media platform will give you greater online visibility to reach new clients and grow your network. Instagram is also a good platform to advertise on, although its users are mostly millennials and Gen Z.\n6. Create and Share Videos That Speak to Expired Listing Leads\nIf you need ideas on what content to use for your social media ads, consider videos. Videos can capture attention, convey your message effectively, and build trust with potential sellers. Here are some video content ideas that you can do to attract expired listings leads:\nEducational Content\nCreate videos that discuss why listings expire and how owners can successfully sell their properties. Topics could include common reasons for expired listings, tips for staging a home, pricing strategies, and the importance of effective marketing. When you provide valuable information for your target audience, you position yourself as a knowledgeable and helpful resource.\nMarket Updates\nYou could also post videos with updates on the local real estate market, such as trends, recent sales, and market conditions. This can make you known as a market expert and keep you top-of-mind for owners who might be reconsidering their selling strategy.\nQ&A Sessions\nIf you already have a lot of followers on Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, you could host live Q&A sessions. Here, you could invite homeowners to ask questions about selling their homes, the real estate market, or why listings expire.\n7. Create an Expired Listings Script\nHaving a pre-written script will make emailing or calling phone numbers on expired listings easier.\nThe script should begin with a short introduction that explains the reason for your communication. You can then mention some reasons why you think the property did not sell and what you would do differently if the listing were renewed with you. Finally, ask for a meeting where you can present your real estate marketing strategy to the seller.\nThe expired listing script should be long enough to cover all the important points without losing the seller\u2019s attention.\nIf you, however, think that writing a script is challenging, you can always turn to websites that offer writing services, including script writing for various lines of business.\nBut instead of paying extra for services that you can easily do, we suggest you give it a try first and ask a fellow agent to go over it with you. You can engage in a bit of a role-playing exercise to see how it works and if there are ways you can improve your script.\n8. Create a Template for an Expired Listings Letter\nAt times, real estate agents looking for expired listings struggle to get in touch with property owners via email or phone. Some owners are not willing to talk to an agent after failing to sell their property previously.\nIn such cases, you can reach potential sellers by sending a letter the old-fashioned way\u2014through their mailbox. This letter should be written using the same formula as the expired scripts:\n\nA good introduction\u00a0\nYour professional opinion on why the property didn\u2019t sell\nThe service you can provide to improve the chances of the property being sold\nUnique marketing ideas for better visibility\nAn invitation to meet so you can present your strategy to the seller\n\nMake sure to write your letter on a professional letterhead and sign it personally.\n9. Call Expired Listing Owners Directly\nOnce you have leads, the next step is to contact the owners directly. And while it\u2019s important to have a script or template prepared, here are other tips on how to improve your chances of convincing the owners to sell their property to you:\nResearch and Prepare\nBefore making the call or sending an email, research the property and owner to understand why the listing may have expired. Was it overpriced, poorly marketed, or in need of repairs? Familiarize yourself with the property details and the local market conditions, so you can be informed and persuasive.\nGet the Timing Right\nChoose an appropriate time to call. Avoid early mornings, late evenings, and weekends. The usual best time to reach people are during the week, especially late in the morning or early afternoon. If you\u2019re using email instead, try to send it so that it reaches the owner\u2019s inbox at 8AM on a weekday. This way, your message will be the first thing they\u2019ll see. Some email platforms have a feature that allows you to schedule sending.\nBe Professional and Courteous\nWhen you call or send an email, introduce yourself clearly and professionally. Explain that you\u2019re a real estate investor who\u2019s interested in their property. Make sure to be respectful and considerate of their time. Lastly, use a friendly and empathetic tone, and acknowledge any frustrations they may have experienced during the selling process.\nPrepare Your Value Proposition\nClearly explain why you\u2019re calling and how you can offer them value. Mention that you noticed their listing has expired and express your interest in discussing a potential purchase. Make sure to highlight any benefits that you can offer, such as a quick closing, buying as-is, or that you\u2019re paying in cash. Finally, emphasize how your proposal can address the issues they may have had that prevented the previous sale.\nListen and Respond\nLet the owner express their concerns and reasons for the expired listing. Address their pain points and offer solutions that align with their needs, so you can build rapport and trust.\nFollow-Up\nIf the owner is not ready to make a decision immediately, ask for permission to follow up. After the phone call, send them a thank you note that also summarizes your conversation and reiterates your interest. When you follow up, keep it consistent and respectful so you can stay on the owner\u2019s radar when they are ready to sell their property.\n10. Create and Automate Drip Marketing Campaigns\nIf you\u2019d rather send emails than make calls, the most efficient way to do it is through drip marketing. Drip marketing campaigns involve sending a series of targeted messages over time to nurture leads and encourage them to engage with your offer. Here\u2019s how to create and automate these campaigns:\nIdentify Your Target Audience\nThe first five methods in this blog post tells you how to find expired listings in your target market. Make sure that you have accurate contact information for the property owners so that your emails won\u2019t go to waste. There are online tools that can verify if an email is valid.\nSegment Your Audience\nNot all expired listings are the same. Divide you audience based on factors such as property type, location, and reasons for expiration. This will help you tailor your messages for each segment more effectively.\nCraft Compelling Messages\nWrite at least two messages that address the specific needs and pain points of each segment. You\u2019d want to write one initial message for each segment and one or two follow-up messages that would be applicable to all segments. They should offer solutions or value propositions, such as a quick sale, fair cash offers, or assistance with repairs. Make sure that each message provides value to the property owner and encourages them to take the next step.\nSet Up an Automated Email Sequence\nUse a customer relationship management (CRM) system or an email marketing platform to automate your drip campaign. A campaign like this usually includes an introduction email plus a series of follow-ups spaced a few days or weeks apart. These follow-ups are only sent if the property owners didn\u2019t reply.\nPersonalize Your Emails\nTo increase your chances of getting a response, personalize your emails by using the property owner\u2019s name, referencing their property, and customizing your messages based on their specific situation.\nInclude Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs)\nMake sure to end each email with a clear and specific CTA, such as scheduling a call, visiting your website, or replying to your email. You should also make it easy for the property owners to take the next step.\nMonitor and Optimize\nTrack the performance of your drip campaign using metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and responses. You can then use these data to improve your messages and timing. You could also A/B test different subject lines and message content to increase your chances of getting a reply.\nNext Steps\nNow that you know how to find those expired real estate listings, what\u2019s next for you? As a real estate professional, there is a big difference between simply knowing how to find a listing and actually making conversions.\nTo do that, you will also need to know how to move forward with the information you have. Here are the next steps you should take if you expect to be successful in providing this type of service to your clients.\n1. Use Real Estate Comps to Your Advantage\nAs a real estate agent, you should already be intimately familiar with the property prices in your area. If you happen to find an expired listing in your backyard, you can easily estimate going rates by comparing it with real estate comps.\nThis makes it easier for you to optimize the selling price on a particular expired listing that makes both buyers and sellers find reasonable and attractive. While there are a lot of websites that offer real estate comps, one of the best out there today is Mashvisor.\nMashvisor is a real estate platform that has helped countless agents and buyers close deals on profitable real estate investments since 2015.

With tools like the Market Finder and Dynamic Pricing, users can easily make accurate and realistic ROI projections with greater confidence.\nUse Mashvisor to look up real estate comps for your target listing.\n2. Start Strategizing to Find Expired\u00a0Real Estate Listings\u00a0\nJust like in any aspect of real estate investing, context plays an important role. As a real estate professional, you have keep up with current trends and behaviors in your local real estate market.\u00a0There is no one-size-fits-all approach to finding expired listings. You need to know how to strategize specifically for the market you\u2019re in.\nFor instance, if you\u2019re a seller, you will need to consider your location and what it has to offer buyers, especially those who are looking for worthwhile investment properties.\nIf many of your clients are real estate investors, you need to know what the market has to offer by way of cap rate and cash on cash return. Those who are into real estate investing will greatly benefit from this.\nSimilarly, as an agent, your knowledge of the area will allow you to come up with the right strategy to find those expired listings. Perhaps it\u2019s more practical for you to go to your city hall to look at the public records than set out to buy expired listings because of some financial restraints.\nMaybe you\u2019re new in town and don\u2019t know much about the area and know very few people, making it harder for you to connect with other professionals. You can try email or online marketing instead.\nAt the end of the day, you should devise and implement a strategy that works best for your situation and context.\n3. Make as Many Contacts as You Can\nLastly, the real estate industry is all about having the right connections. People run this business. And this business is all about the people. That said, as a real estate professional, you need to make as many contacts as you can. Put yourself out there for others to see. To make it in this business, you need to be outgoing and people-oriented.\nYou are not merely investing money in pursuing the right leads and closing deals. You are investing your time in people because these people will open doors for you to walk in.\nGrow your network. Join clubs. Attend conferences and seminars. Call other agents. Check up on former clients and ask for referrals. Introduce yourself to new people.\nThis may be more challenging for an introvert, but you don\u2019t have to be an extrovert to succeed. You just need to be consistent in growing your network so you can find good leads on good deals, including expired real estate listings.\nConclusion\nAnyone can learn how to find expired real estate listings. However, this type of listing can be very tricky to get because property owners are wary of going through the same selling process. You need to be sensitive to the property owners and address their concerns sincerely if they are to trust you.\nThe tips mentioned in this article will make the process of finding, securing, and relisting expired listings much easier for both experienced and new real estate agents. You just need to find the right strategy that works best for your situation and have the discipline to turn it into a habit.\nIt may not be as easy for everyone, but commitment and consistency will help elevate your game and make you successful at spotting those expired listings.

However, there are certain recurring expenses that rental property owners need to incur in order to run a smooth, well-protected business. One of these expenses to take into consideration is the landlord insurance cost. While properly insuring your rental is a must to avoid various potential problems down the road, it comes at a certain price, which needs to be factored into your investment property analysis.\n\nIn this article, we will cover everything you need to know about the cost of protecting your income property against damage and yourself against liability. We\u2019ll explore the main factors that affect prices as well as what types of policies you can get and how they impact cost. We\u2019ll provide you with actionable tips on how to strike the right balance between cost and coverage for optimal investment results.\nTable of Contents\n\nFactors Influencing the Cost of Landlord Insurance\u00a0\nAverage Landlord Insurance Cost\nTypes of Insurance Policies and Their Costs\nTips for Lowering Rental Property Insurance Premiums\nBalancing Cost and Coverage\nConclusion\n\nFactors Influencing the Cost of Landlord Insurance\nBefore getting into \u201cHow much is landlord insurance?\u201d, it\u2019s important to understand the circumstances and elements that affect the cost.\nHere are the 8 most significant factors that play a role in determining the cost:\nProperty Location and Risks\nWhen trying to figure out how much you\u2019ll need to pay for protecting your income property, the main point to take into consideration is your home\u2019s location. Once again, the market where you invest is crucial in real estate investment.\nThere are a few different ways in which location affects cost, including:\n\nProperty values: The current market value of the rental that you are insuring is present in the insurance premium calculation formula. Protecting your house tends to be more expensive in markets where real estate prices are higher because companies will need to pay more in case of damage or destruction. So, you can expect to have to pay more for your insurance coverage in states with high values like New York and California.\nNatural disasters: Natural disasters such as fires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, and lightning are some of the major risks covered by investment property insurance. Understandably, locations prone to natural disasters incur higher landlord insurance costs to cover for the more frequent need to use the protection. This means that investors in Texas, California, Washington, and Florida (considered among the most dangerous) pay higher premiums \u2013 on average \u2013 than property owners in Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Connecticut (considered among the safest).\nCrime rates: The best rental insurance policies protect against vandalism, theft, burglary, and other forms of violence against homes. As a result, costs are higher in states and cities with high crime rates due to the increased risk incurred by the insurer. Consequently, landlords usually have to pay higher premiums in cities like Monrow, LA, Memphis, TN, Detroit, MI, and Birmingham, AL (with the highest crime rates nationwide) than in cities such as Gilbert, AZ, Frisco, TX, Glendale, CA, and Cary, NC (with the lowest crime rates).\n\nProperty Type and Value\nThe second factor that influences the landlord insurance cost is the type of the property and the value of the home.\nInsuring a single-family home tends to cost more than buying townhouse or condo insurance, for example. The reason is that a single-family home usually has a bigger square footage and comes with more additional structures, such as a garage, a patio, a swimming pool, and others. So, how much is condo insurance in the US market? It\u2019s an average of $455 per year.\nMoreover, rental homes that cost more incur higher premiums as it will be more expensive to repair them, not to mention to rebuild them from scratch.\nProperty Age and Condition\nBuildings that are older and that are in a poor condition are usually more costly to insure. This is because they might be at increased risk of damage during covered natural disasters. Moreover, such types of properties pose additional risks to the health and wellbeing of tenants and their guests, and medical and legal expenses for bodily injury is one of the main items covered by insurance companies.\nTenant Types\nThe tenants that investors plan to lease to also affect the landlord insurance cost. For example, students and short-term guests are more likely to cause damages to rental properties. This is the reason for the elevated price of insurance in college towns as well as of Airbnb insurance.\nMarket Legislation\nAnother factor that affects the cost of rental insurance is the legal environment in the location where you invest. For instance, more tenant-friendly states (like Vermont, Nebraska, and New York) might require landlords to obtain additional liability coverage to protect renters. This will naturally inflate the price.\nAt the same time, landlord-friendly states (such as Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina) might have more lenient requirements, so real estate investors might be fine with covering just the basics.\nType and Extent of Coverage\nYet another major determinant of the landlord insurance cost is the exact type and coverage of the policy. While a standard policy covers the basics such as property damage, personal liability, and loss of rental income, there are many additional items that investors can opt in for. These include things like vandalism, theft, and more natural disasters.\nThe wider the coverage of your policy, the higher the cost.\nDeductible Amounts\nThe deductible amounts for each item included in the insurance also affect the overall cost. The more money you expect to receive from the insurance company in case of a covered event, the more you will have to pay them beforehand, for the increased protection.\nClaims History\nFinally, insurers look at the landlord\u2019s claims history when quoting a price. Individuals who have filed a lot of claims in the past are considered high risk, so they will be expected to pay higher premiums as they are more likely to need to file a claim again in the future.\nAverage Landlord Insurance Cost\nFind out the average landlord insurance cost in the US\nAccording to Steadily national real estate market analysis, the average rental property insurance cost across the US is $1,478 per year. However, there are major differences between the average values in different US states: from as low as $595 in Oklahoma to as high as $2,419 in Delaware.\nAs you can see, this is a four-fold difference, caused by the factors discussed above, such as median home prices, local market risks, and local legislations and regulations.\nThe price difference between landlord insurance vs homeowners insurance is about 25% for the same property, on average, with the former being more expensive. This is due to the increased risk associated with renting out a property to tenants rather than living there yourself. This leads to a wider coverage, which is reflected in the inflated price.\nMoreover, special types of rental property insurance such as Airbnb insurance cost even more because of the more risky nature of short term rental activities than traditional, long term renting. The annual price of short term rental insurance in the US market averages around $2,000.\nTypes of Insurance Policies and Their Costs\nLandlord insurance coverage is as diverse as the world of real estate investing itself. Different companies offer different basic policies with the ability to further customize coverage to provide the exact level of protection that an investor needs, while keeping the cost in mind too.\nThere are three main types of rental insurance that include:\nDP-1 Policy\nThe most basic type of insurance for rental homes is DP-1, also referred to as Dwelling Fire Form 1. This is a peril policy because it provides coverage for the primary structure only for perils that are specifically listed in the policy. Typically, these perils include:\n\nFire\nLighting\nSmoke\nWindstorms and hailstorms\nVolcanic explosions\nInternal and external explosions\nVehicles\nAircraft\nRiots or civil commotion\n\nImportantly, DP-1 covers the actual cash value of the damage to the property caused by one of the named perils. It doesn\u2019t cover the replacement cost, as more advanced and comprehensive types of insurances do.\nLandlords should also know that DP-1 does not cover damages to additional structures (unless included in the policy at an extra cost), personal liability, and rental income loss.\nThe DP-1 landlord insurance cost is the cheapest because of the limited coverage. This policy is usually optimal for vacant rentals, properties located in calm markets, and investors on a tight budget.\nDP-2 Policy\nThe second type is DP-2, also considered a peril insurance. Similar to DP-1, it protects against named perils, but the list is longer also including:\n\nFalling objects\nBroken glass\nFreezing pipes\nElectrical damage\nAccidental water or stream overflow\nSnow and ice weight\nCracking, bulging, or tearing\nCollapse\nVandalism\nTheft\n\nDP-2 covers both the primary structure and additional or detached structures. Lost rental income is usually included, but in some cases it needs to be paid for additionally. Personal landlord liability insurance is, however, not covered by DP-2 insurance for landlords.\nThe cost of this type is higher than of DP-1 because of the more comprehensive coverage, but it\u2019s usually worth it considering the additional protection for the income property and its belonging structures.\nDP-3 Policy\nThe third and most comprehensive type of rental property insurance is DP-3. Unlike DP-1 and DP-2, this is an open peril insurance, meaning that it covers perils resulting in all losses, rather than strict and limited lists of perils. The few perils that might be excluded from DP-3 comprise earth movement, power failure, water damage, neglect, intentional loss, governmental action, ordinance or law, and mold. In many cases, these perils can be added for all-inclusive coverage.\nIn terms of covered items, this type protects against damages to the primary structure and the additional structures, loss of rental income, and personal liability. Importantly, payouts are made on the basis of replacement cash value rather than the actual cash value. Depreciation will not be factored in.\nThe landlord insurance cost of DP-3 is the highest among all policies available to investment property owners. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a good idea to get this policy if you are actively renting out your home and do not want to face unexpected expenses.\nOptional Coverage\nIn addition to the type of insurance (DP-1, DP-2, or DP-3), another major factor affecting the price is the optional coverages selected by a landlord. Each investor needs to decide for themselves what extra coverages to opt for, depending on their particular situation, including things like market peculiarities, rental property history, tolerance to risk, and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 budget.\nSome of the most popular additional coverages recommended by industry experts are:\n\nVandalism coverage\nTheft coverage\nBuilding code coverage\nHeating or air conditioning loss coverage\nVacant rental endorsement\n\nThe cost of each of these coverages is added separately and can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars, depending on the additional coverage and the insured amount.\nTips for Lowering Rental Property Insurance Premiums\nWhile there are some standard values and prices dominating the insurance industry, landlords can get major discounts if they do certain things.\nHere are a few tips to follow to minimize your landlord insurance cost without sacrificing coverage:\nRisk Mitigation Measures\nThe best way to keep the price of your real estate investor insurance under control and to keep your property safe is to minimize the risks associated with your rental. For example, you should conduct regular maintenance and fix minor issues before they turn into major problems. Well-maintained investment properties are cheaper to insure as they result in fewer incidents and less frequent claims.\nSafety Improvements\nSecond, you should look into ways to boost the safety and security of your rental home. Installing a sophisticated home security system will incur a major one-time cost, but it will save you money from the annual premiums down the road as insurance agents will see your property as low risk.\nPolicy Customization\nEach rental property and each landlord is different, so each policy should be different \u2013 customized to the specific needs of the rental and the owner. When customizing your policy, it\u2019s important to answer the question \u201cHow much insurance do I need?\u201d The response should depend on multiple factors, including the location, the property type and size, the property age and features, the external structures, the monthly rental rate, the required additional coverages, and your preferences.\nBundling with Other Policies\nYou can also lower your landlord insurance cost by bundling a few rental properties under a single policy or bundling your insurance for investment properties with other types of insurance, such as homeowners insurance or auto insurance. Most companies offer sizable discounts to individuals who get multiple policies from them.\nAnnual Premium Payments\nYet another possible source of discounts on the insurance price is paying the insurance premium on an annual \u2013 rather than a monthly \u2013 basis. Companies prefer that they receive the entire amount at the beginning of the year, so they are willing to provide lower rates for landlords choosing annual premiums.\nWorking with Rental Property Insurance Companies\nLast but not least, while all insurance companies (like Allstate Insurance, State Farm Insurance, Liberty Mutual, and Farmers Insurance Group) provide landlord insurance, the ones who specialize in this type of policies tend to offer the best pricing. For example, Steadily offers competitive rates for real estate investors across the US market.\nBalancing Cost and Coverage\nWhen choosing the best landlord insurance policy for your rental property, it\u2019s key to strike the right balance between the coverage you and your investment will receive and the price you will need to pay. After all, this is one more expense that you need to incur as a real estate investor, and it needs to be factored into your rental property analysis to ensure positive cash flow and strong return on investment.\nThere are a few important considerations you need to take into account when balancing between coverage and price that include:\n\nThe type of coverage you need: damage, personal liability, and/or loss of rental income\nThe property coverage you want: primary structure vs additional structures too\nThe optional coverage you expect: vandalism, theft, water damage, etc.\nThe amount of coverage\n\nYour decision should be guided by the characteristics of your rental, your market and local peculiarities, and your preferences as an investor. Ultimately, you need to choose coverage that you will feel comfortable with and that is within your budget to stay on track and generate profit from your investment.\nConclusion\nThe landlord insurance cost that you will need to pay is one of the many decisions you have to make and one of the multiple factors you should consider to have a well-protected investment that generates high yields. While having this type of insurance is not obligatory in the US market, it can help you and your property stay protected at times of turmoil.\nChoosing the right policy and the optimal coverage, you have to take into account both what level of protection you need and the price you will have to pay for it. In most cases, having a more comprehensive policy makes financial sense in locations characterized by high natural disaster occurrences and high crime rates and for homes that are older and less well-maintained. Newer houses with a high level of security that are placed in safe locations require less coverage.\nIn any case, you should talk to a few different insurance agents and get quotes from several companies to obtain the best price.\n\n\n\nProtect Your Short-Term Rental Investment with Airbnb Insurance\nGet peace of mind for your property\nGet a quote\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Investment Property Search!    \n\nSTART FREE TRIAL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n0 FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\n\n\n\nThe Complete Guide to Price to Rent Ratio in Real Estate Investing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Post\n\n\n\nBRRRR Strategy: The Ultimate Guide for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n7 Best Short Term Rental Insurance Companies for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\n12 Types of Real Estate Investor Insurance\n\n\n\n\nAirbnb AirCover: What Hosts Need to Know\n\n\n\n\nWhat Insurance Do I Need as a Landlord?: Essential Coverage for Investors\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential Guide to Short Term Rental Insurance for Airbnb Property Investors\n\n\n\n\nInvestor\u2019s Guide to Condo Insurance: Protecting Your Condominium Investment\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential Guide to Multifamily Insurance for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Your Paradise: A Deep-Dive into Vacation Rental Insurance\n\n\n\n\nProperty Damage Coverage: Real Estate Investor Guide to Protection and Peace of Mind\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing Protection: A Comprehensive Guide to Commercial Landlord Insurance\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Rental Property Insurance for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 Best Landlord Insurance Companies: Protecting Your Investment"}

Knowing the value of an investment property can help you determine whether it will make a good investment, as well as its overall profitability.\n\nThis comprehensive guide is designed specifically for real estate investors who seek to master the art of property valuation. In this article, we will discuss why it is important to know how to calculate property value accurately, the factors that influence an investment property\u2019s value, and the different property valuation methods.\nKey Takeaways:\n\nProperty value is the current market value of an investment property.\nInvestors need to calculate property value to determine an investment property\u2019s profitability.\nA property value estimate is typically determined using its assessed value, appraised value, and/or fair market value.\nYou can use a cap rate calculator to value income-generating properties.\nProperty value is influenced by certain factors like location, market trends, property condition, and legal considerations.\nYou can calculate property value using different methods: comparative market analysis, income approach, cost approach, and sales comparison approach.\n\nIntroduction to Property Valuation in Real Estate Investment\nProperty valuation is an important component in real estate investment as it helps assess the profitability of a property. Note that the value of a property fluctuates with market conditions and other factors that affect real estate prices. As an investor, you should do your own research to calculate property value accurately before making any investment decision.\u00a0\nWhat Is Property Value and Why Does it Matter?\nFind out what property value is and why it\u2019s crucially important for investors\nProperty value generally refers to the current estimated fair market value of a real estate property and is a critical aspect of a comprehensive real estate analysis. It is essentially the ideal selling price for a property when it is listed in the market today.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs an investor, knowing how to calculate property value correctly is crucial because it helps you determine whether or not it will generate gainful returns. Finding the correct property market value can help you maximize your profits by making the right decisions for your investment.\u00a0\nFor example, if you\u2019re buying a rental property, knowing the property value can assist you in setting the correct rental rate. It can also tell you whether or not repairs are needed to help increase its value and consequently push up your rental price and occupancy rate too.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re planning to buy a property for future resale, finding the house market value tells how much profit you can possibly earn. It also shows the appreciation rate of the property, helping you decide the best time to sell and how much you should sell it for to gain profits, allowing you\u00a0 to maximize your returns.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Basics of Calculating Property Value for Investors\nKnowing how to calculate home values can influence your investment strategies, potential profitability, and investment decisions regarding buying, selling, renovating, or renting properties. To do this, investors need to do thorough research, gather necessary real estate data, and conduct proper real estate investment analysis.\u00a0\nHere are tips to gather real estate data:\n\nUtilize Online Real Estate Platforms: You can use websites like Zillow or Redfin to gather real estate data. But if you want extensive data on property listings, sales, neighborhood comps, rental strategies, and market trends, Mashvisor is your best option.\nCheck Public Records: Property sales, tax assessments, and deeds are public records often available online through local government websites.\nNetwork with Local Real Estate Agents: Agents have firsthand market knowledge and access to Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data.\nJoin Real Estate Investment Groups and Forums: These can be valuable sources for shared experiences and local market data.\nAnalyze Economic and Demographic Data: Understand the broader economic environment, including job growth, population trends, and development plans in your area of interest.\n\nWhen gathering data, make sure to avoid these common pitfalls:\n\nNot Choosing the Right Online Data Source: Some online data can be outdated or inaccurate. Make sure that your online source is reliable and updated. When in doubt, use Mashvisor \u2013 this real estate analytics platform provides the most accurate and updated real estate data, helping you make right investment decisions.\nIgnoring Local Market Specifics: Real estate markets can vary greatly even within the same city. Understand local dynamics.\nOverlooking Property-Specific Issues: Don\u2019t ignore factors like property condition, legal disputes, or zoning changes.\nNeglecting Historical Data: Current trends are important, but understanding historical market patterns is also crucial.\nFailing to Regularly Update Data: Real estate markets change quickly. Regularly update your data to ensure it reflects current conditions.\n\nPerforming real estate valuation manually can be time-consuming and tedious. Fortunately, there are real estate valuation tools you can use to help calculate property value correctly.\u00a0\nMashvisor offers all the necessary information related to a particular investment property. It provides real estate tools (including the property value heat map) that are useful for both new and experienced real estate investors. This helps investors decide where and what property to invest in, what investment strategy to use, and how to improve their returns.\nDifferent Types of Property Valuations\nTo calculate property value, investors and real estate experts often consider these three main types of property valuation:\n\n Assessed Value\n\nThe assessed value of a property is the dollar valuation assigned by local tax assessors for the purpose of calculating property taxes. This figure can change as the property\u2019s market value appreciates or depreciates. However, it is often lower than the actual market value at which the property could sell.\nFor instance, a home might have a market value of $500,000 based on current real estate trends, buyer demand, and its features. However, the local tax assessor may determine its assessed value to be $400,000, reflecting a range of factors including historical values, general market conditions in the area, and specific assessment rules.\u00a0\n\n Appraised Value\n\nThe appraised value of a property is the estimated worth determined by a professional home appraiser through the process known as investment property appraisal. This value is based on various factors such as the property\u2019s size, location, condition, features, amenities, any upgrades it may have, and the sale prices of comparable homes in the area.\nA home appraisal is crucial in the property buying process, as mortgage lenders typically require it before approving a loan to ensure that the property is worth the amount being borrowed. This value can influence the loan amount, terms, and even the viability of the purchase.\nFor example, if you\u2019re looking to buy a house listed at $350,000, the lender will commission an appraisal to verify this value. The appraiser might assess the home\u2019s value at $340,000 based on the sales prices of recently sold homes with similar features in the same neighborhood, state of repair, and amenities. In most cases, lenders will approve a loan amount based on the appraised value.\u00a0\n\n Fair Market Value (FMV)\n\nIn real estate investing, the fair market value of a property is the price that a willing and informed buyer would pay and a willing and informed seller would accept under normal conditions in an open and competitive market.\u00a0\nThis value is influenced by various factors, including the local housing market\u2019s condition, the property\u2019s size, location, condition, and any unique features. You can use an online fair market value calculator to determine the current fair market value of the property.\nFor example, consider a house in a sought-after neighborhood with excellent schools and amenities. If similar houses in the area have recently sold for around $450,000, and this house is in comparable or better condition, its fair market value would likely align with this range.\u00a0\nHowever, if the local real estate market is experiencing a downturn, with fewer buyers and decreasing home prices, the FMV might be lower than expected, reflecting the current market state. FMV is a crucial concept in real estate transactions, providing a realistic estimate of what the property could sell for at any given time.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Calculating Property Value Accurately\nAccurate property valuation is essential for a successful real estate investing, as it directly impacts several aspects of your investment, including:\n\nAssessing Your Potential Return on Investment (ROI)\n\nInvestors should learn how to calculate market value of property accurately to make profitable decisions about purchasing, selling, or renting out real estate assets.\u00a0\nOne of the best ways to determine an investment property\u2019s ROI is its cap rate, which is the rate of return that takes into account the property\u2019s net operating income and current market value.\u00a0\n\nSecuring Financing\u00a0\n\nYou need to calculate property value accurately to secure financing, as lenders rely on property valuations to determine the loan amount they are willing to offer.\u00a0\nIn general, a property appraised at a high value can lead to more favorable loan terms and higher borrowing limits. An accurate appraisal also protects lenders by ensuring the loan amount does not exceed the property\u2019s worth, mitigating their risk in case of default.\n\nDetermining the Purchase Price\n\nIf you calculate property value accurately when you\u2019re buying an investment property, you will know if the asking price is fair enough based on the home\u2019s actual value.\u00a0\nSimilarly, if you\u2019re planning to sell your home, an accurate property valuation helps you determine the right listing price without compromising your opportunities to maximize your profits.\u00a0\nHow Property Valuation Affects Your Investment Strategy\nWhen you calculate property value precisely, you can estimate the potential income a property might generate through rent or its future resale value, providing you with a clear vision on its ROI. This assessment helps in formulating the right investment strategies that maximize profits and minimize risks.\u00a0\nUsing the property value, you can determine the best investment strategy by calculating the cap rate of an investment property. Cap rate, or capitalization rate, is the rate of return of a property based on its estimated net income and present market value. To calculate the cap rate, you need to divide the net operating income by the property\u2019s current market value.\nWhile calculating cap rate manually is feasible, this can be prone to error. Fortunately, you can use Mashvisor\u2019s cap rate calculator, which provides accurate real estate data that can help you find the best rental strategy for a particular investment. This helps you decide whether the property is best for long term or short term rentals.\nMashvisor Cap Rate Calculator\nClick here to start a 7-day free trial of Mashvisor.\nRisks of Overestimating Property Value\nOvervaluation can lead to paying too much for a property, resulting in lower returns or even losses. As an investor, you need to calculate property value accurately to avoid several risks, such as:\n\nInflated Purchase Prices: Overestimating a property\u2019s value can lead to paying more than it\u2019s worth, affecting your potential ROI. This becomes problematic if the market drops, potentially resulting in a property valued lower than its purchase price.\nFinancing and Refinancing Difficulties: Loans are typically based on the property\u2019s appraised values. An overestimated value may secure a larger loan, but this could lead to challenges in loan repayment, especially if the property\u2019s real value is lower (which means your rental rate could also be lower). It can also adversely affect refinancing options if the property is later valued lower.\nHigher Property Taxes and Insurance Premiums: Property taxes and landlord insurance costs are often linked to the assessed value of a property. Overestimation can lead to unnecessarily high taxes and fees, burdening the property owner financially.\nMisaligned Investment Strategies: Investors may make suboptimal decisions, like missing profitable opportunities or holding properties based on inflated valuations. This can disrupt investment portfolios, leading to reduced liquidity and higher market risk exposure.\n\nKey Factors That Influence Property Value\nSeveral factors influence property value, affecting its overall worth. As an investor, you need to take these factors into account when you calculate property value to ensure you get an accurate figure.\nHere are the things that you should consider:\nLocation: The Prime Determinant of Property Value\nThe old adage \u201clocation, location, location\u201d still holds true, especially when finding the best investment property. Location is the primary factor that determines the value of a property as it dictates desirability and accessibility.\u00a0\nProperties situated in desirable locations, such as city centers, affluent neighborhoods, or scenic areas, typically command higher prices due to their increased demand. Also, properties in these locations have high appreciation rates \u2013 meaning, you can benefit from high returns should you decide to sell the property in the future. In addition, since prime locations tend to have higher rental demands, you can charge high rental rates too.\nConversely, properties in less favorable locations, possibly due to high crime rates, poor infrastructure, or lack of nearby facilities, tend to have lower values and low appreciation rates. These areas also have lower demand for rentals, which can adversely affect your occupancy rate as well as your rental income.\nThe Role of Market Conditions in Valuing Real Estate\nMarket trends provide a broader picture of how property values change in real estate. When there are more people looking to buy homes than there are homes for sale (high demand and low supply), property prices usually go up. In contrast, if there are many homes available but fewer buyers (high supply and low demand), prices tend to drop.\u00a0\nInterest rates also matter \u2013 lower rates can make buying homes more affordable, increasing demand and prices, whereas higher rates can have the opposite effect. In short, the balance of supply and demand, along with the overall economic environment, are essential factors to consider when you calculate property value.\nPhysical Characteristics and Their Impact on Value\nThe physical characteristics of a property, like its size, age, layout, and condition, greatly impact its value. A home with bigger square footage and more bedrooms and bathrooms usually costs more than a smaller one.\u00a0\nSimilarly, newer properties or those that have been well-maintained or recently renovated are typically valued higher because they require less repair and upkeep. Unique features like a modern kitchen, a spacious yard, or a swimming pool can also increase a property\u2019s appeal and price. In simple terms, the better a property looks and functions, the more it\u2019s usually worth.\nLegal and Economic Factors in Property Valuation\nLegally, things like zoning laws, property rights, and any restrictions on property use can affect a property\u2019s potential and, therefore, its value. For instance, a property zoned for both residential and commercial use might be more valuable than one zoned for residential use only.\nEconomically, factors like the overall health of the economy, employment rates, and inflation can influence property values. A strong economy with high employment typically leads to higher property values as more people can afford to buy homes. In contrast, during economic downturns, property values may decrease as fewer people are buying homes.\u00a0\nThese legal and economic factors combined help determine how much a property is worth.\n4 Different Methods to Calculate Property Value\nHere are 4 methods to calculate property value\nReal estate investors can use any of the following methods to calculate property value:\nComparative Market Analysis\nComparative market analysis is a technique used to calculate property value by comparing it with similar properties that have recently been sold. This method looks at key features like location and features.\u00a0\nThe comparable properties should be located in the same neighborhood, or at least within the same area or city. In addition, to make a more accurate property valuation, you also need to consider the comps\u2019 features, like amenities, whether they are furnished or not, size, and the properties\u2019 condition and age.\nMashvisor\u2019s comparative market analysis tool helps you check neighborhood comps so you can see how much similar properties within the same area are worth. Not only that, but you can also see how much they rent for based on your chosen rental strategy (either for short term or long term rentals).\nIncome Approach\nThe income approach is a real estate valuation method that calculates a property\u2019s value based on the income it generates. It\u2019s especially useful for commercial and residential properties that earn rent. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n Estimate Gross Income: Determine the property\u2019s expected yearly income from rent.\n Account for Vacancies and Losses: Subtract estimated losses from vacancies and other factors.\n Subtract Operating Expenses: Deduct costs like maintenance, homeowners insurance for rental property, and utilities to find the net operating income (NOI).\n Determine Cap Rate: This is the expected return rate from the property, calculated as the discount rate minus the property\u2019s growth rate.\n Calculate Property Value: Divide the NOI by the cap rate.\n\nFor example, imagine a long term rental property that could make $50,000 annually from rent. If there\u2019s a 10% vacancy rate plus other estimated losses and operating expenses are $12,000, the NOI would be:\nNOI = $50,000 \u2013 ($50,000 x 10%) \u2013 $12,000 = $33,000\u00a0\nIf the desired return on investment is 10%, the property\u2019s value would be:\u00a0\nProperty Value = $33,000 / 0.10 = $330,000\u00a0\nThis method is useful for investors to estimate the worth of income-generating properties and their potential returns.\nCost Approach\nThe cost approach will calculate property value by estimating what it would cost to build the house again from scratch using today\u2019s construction standards and costs. This includes the cost of the land, labor expenses, construction costs, cost of building materials, and legal and insurance costs.\nFor example, if rebuilding a house would cost $200,000 for materials and labor, and the land is worth $50,000, then the property\u2019s estimated value using the cost approach would be $250,000. This method is particularly useful for new or unique properties where comparable sales data might not be available.\nSales Comparison Approach\nThe sales comparison approach values a property by looking at the prices of similar properties recently sold in the same area. It uses the mean or median value of these prices as a guide. This method also takes into account details like the property\u2019s size, number of rooms, amenities, condition, and other important features.\nFor example, if three similar houses in a neighborhood sold for $300,000, $320,000, and $350,000, the approach might use the median price of $320,000 as a basis to calculate property value of comparable houses (real estate comps) in the same area. This method is helpful to understand what buyers are willing to pay for similar properties.\nMaking Smart Real Estate Investments with Accurate Property Value Calculations\nTo be a successful real estate investor, you need to know how to calculate property value accurately so you can make well-informed decisions. You can check the assessed value, appraised value, and fair market value of the property to know how much it\u2019s really worth.\u00a0\nUse the comparative market analysis, income approach, cost approach, or sales comparison approach when evaluating an investment property. Make sure to consider the key factors that affect the property value when choosing an investment as these factors can also greatly impact your overall profitability.\u00a0\nStart a 7-day free trial with Mashvisor today and learn how we can help you calculate property value accurately.\n\n\nStart Your Investment Property Search!    \n\nSTART FREE TRIAL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n0 FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\n\n\n\nThe Essential Guide to Multifamily Insurance for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Post\n\n\n\nHow Much Is Condo Insurance for Real Estate Investors?\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to know about real estate property valuation?\n\n\n\n\nRoofstock Reviews: Is the Platform Helpful to Real Estate Investors?\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the Real Estate Forecast for the Next 5 Years\n\n\n\n\nShould You Use Zillow Home Values When Pricing Your Investment Property?\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate Investing for Beginners: Net Present Value Formula\n\n\n\n\nThe 6 Steps of Buying an Investment Property\n\n\n\n\n50% Rule: Yay or Nay for Estimating Investment Property Costs?\n\n\n\n\nShould You Be Buying Atlanta Investment Properties for Sale in 2018?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Good Cap Rate for Rental Properties?\n\n\n\n\nMashvisor\u2019s Real Estate Data and Analytics: Must-Have for Investors\n\n\n\n\nFind Income Properties the Smart Way Using Mashvisor\n\n\n\n\nWhy You Don\u2019t Need to Memorize the Cash on Cash Return Formula Anymore"}

In rental properties, you earn your income by collecting monthly rent from the tenants who live in your properties.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore you can even start collecting any rent from your tenants you need to locate a property to invest in, and figure out a real estate investment strategy that will ensure you are making money from your investment property. There is a lot of research needed to be done to make sure you are making a smart investment decision.\nThe most important part of your investment strategy is your rate of return on rental property. This is what ensures you make a profit and a steady income on your real estate investment. Continue reading this article to learn more about what a good return on investment is for rental properties and how to calculate your ROI.\n\n\nWhat Exactly Is a Return on Investment?\n\n\nA return on investment, or an ROI, is a type of measurement used in real estate to determine how much money is made from an investment. This is typically calculated as a percentage of the cost of the investment.\nOverall, return on investment is essential for investors as it shows them how well their investment dollars are being used. ROI helps investors commit to an investment property as they are certain there will be a rate of return on rental property.\n\n\nHow Do I Calculate a Return on Investment?\n\n\nHow to calculate ROI on rental property\u2019s is actually quite simple, you need to use this equation;\n\n\nROI = Annual Returns / Cost of Investment x 100\n\n\nIf this seems a little difficult to understand, you can also look at this equation to calculate your ROI. Although they appear different, they are still the same and will generate the same number.\n\n\nROI = (Gain \u2013 Cost) / Cost\u00a0\n\n\n\nGain refers to your investment gain\nCost refers to investment cost\n\n\n\n\u00a0Although these equations might seem easy, there are other factors you need to consider too as an investor. These other factors are essential as they also impact your rate of return on rental property even though they are not calculated originally in these equations. Some factors to consider are:\n\n\n\nMaintenance and repair costs.\nThe amount of money borrowed in the original investment ( which can also include interest). This term is also referred to as leverage.\nAny additional loans or mortgages.\n\n\n\nAll of this may be overwhelming to try to keep in mind when calculating your return on investment for your rental properties. Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator Tool is a great way for investors to calculate their return on investment without having to try to remember any and all factors that could impact it.\nMashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator Tool helps investors calculate their finances, and view calculated returns all in one place. Rather than trying to make many confusing spreadsheets and do all of the calculations on your own, the Rental Property Calculator does it all for you in one place.\nMashvisor\u2019s tool lets investors use their own numbers, relative to their rental property, to calculate their ROI so it is specific to their investment property. Additionally, the Rental Property Calculator shows investors other real estate data such as estimated costs on the interest rate, property taxes, and maintenance on the property.\u00a0\n\n\nMashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator tool stands out from others as it provides investors with a rental strategy for their investment properties. This tool shows investors comparisons between how the property would do as a rental property vs a traditional property vs an Airbnb property. This clearly shows investors which investment strategy will be the most profitable.\nAdditionally, this tool shows investors cash on cash return, cap rate, cash flow, rental income, and rental occupancy rate. Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator tool is also known as the Investment Property Calculator tool.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Is a Good Return on Investment?\n\n\nThere are a few factors that determine what is a good return on investment for your real estate property. These factors are usually what kind of property that rental property is. For example, your rental property could be a vacation property, which is more like an Airbnb-style rental, or a long-term rental property. Both would have slight terms on what is considered a good return on investment.\n\n\nAnother factor that determines how good your return on investment percentage is depends on your method of financing your investment property. Typically, investors use the methods of mortgages or cash for financing their investment rental properties.\nDepending on if you have been a long-term real estate investor or you are just starting to get into the business, you will have different sources of income to finance your investments. Some investors have many larger financial resources than others, therefore they are more likely to use cash to finance their investments.\nOther investors will choose to use a mortgage to finance their investments, which actually usually increases their return on investment in the long run. This is because it reduces the initial cost of the investment and provides them more leverage to acquire more properties in less amount of time.\n\n\nOverall, you have to take into consideration the method of financing to determine if it is a good return on investment.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Is Considered a Good ROI on a Rental Property Financed With Cash?\n\n\nIf you are an investor considering purchasing a property with cash, you would have to use the cap rate to determine your ROI. Basically, Cap Rate, also known as capitalization rate, is the ratio of the NOI ( Net Operating Income)\u00a0 on the property, to its market value.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you are considering financing your rental investment property with cash, you might be wondering now \u201c how do I calculate cap rate?\u201d. This equation can help determine the cap rate:\n\n\nCap Rate = NOI/ Fair Market Value x 100\n\n\nTo calculate your Net Operating Income (NOI), use this equation:\n\n\nAnnual Rental Income \u2013 Annual Rental Expenses\u00a0\n\n\nYou can also refer to Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator tool to view your cap rate.\n\n\nAfter you have determined your cap rate on your rental investment property you can calculate your rate of return on rental property. For properties financed by cash, investors and the real estate market consider 4% a good cap rate.\nAlthough many things can impact this percentage such as the location of the property, the type of property it is, and monthly costs. No matter the type of property or location, when you are considering purchasing an investment property, the average cap rate of rentals in the area should the minimum percent you are looking for before you purchase a property to ensure it will be a good investment.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat Is Considered a Good ROI on a Rental Property Financed With a Mortgage?\n\n\nInstead of using a cap rate to help determine your rate of return on rental property like you do with a property financed with cash, you have to look at cash on cash return for rental properties financed with a mortgage.\nOverall, cash on cash return basically shows investors the amount of money a rental property will produce. This is based on the amount of money put into the property but doesn\u2019t take into consideration the money that was borrowed to finance the property. Something that differentiates the cap rate formula and the cash on cash return formula is that the cash on cash return formula considers financing costs.\n\n\nTo calculate cash on cash return,\u00a0 ( Coc return) follow this equation:\n\n\nCoc Return: Annual Pre-Tax Cash / Total Cash Invested x 100\n\n\nIf these calculations seem overwhelming, consider using Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator tool to calculate your cash on cash return along with any other calculation needed to determine if a property is worth investing in.\n\n\nNow that you know how to calculate your cash on cash return, you are probably wondering \u201cwhat is a good rate of return on rental property on a mortgage financed rental property?\u201d Investors consider anything between 8% and 12% a good rate of return on rental property that is financed by a mortgage.\nIf you are an investor, it is important to note that the percentages of cash on cash return will always be higher than the cap rate as a CoC return is the most reduced cost of investment. Alike cap rate though, you should keep in mind that a good ROI for rental property will change due to factors such as the location of the property and style of property.\n\n\nWhat Is Considered a Good ROI on a Vacation or Airbnb Rental Property?\n\n\nAlthough the factor of how your vacation rental property is financed should be considered when determining what is a good rate of return on rental property, vacation rental ROI is slightly different, despite how it was financed. Anything between 10% and 20% is considered a good ROI for vacation rentals.\nJust like any rental property, the location of the pretty and the style of property is also influencing its ROI. Use Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator to help determine the rate of return on rental property. This tool takes all factors, such as the type of property and the location of the property into consideration when doing its calculations.\u00a0\n\n\nHow Do I Maximize my ROI in My Rental Property?\n\n\n\nThe best way to maximize your ROI in your rental property is to use the proper tools to help create accurate calculations. Mashvisor\u2019s Rental Property Calculator provides extremely accurate calculations so investors can be sure of their real estate investment decisions. This tool allows investors to use their own data to create the most precise calculations.\nDepending on how you financed your rental property, you will need to look at either cap rate or cash on cash return to know your ROI.

That\u2019s where investing in a good channel manager comes in.\nThis guide spells out everything property managers need to know about integrating a channel manager with their vacation rental strategy. From what a channel manager is to how it can help streamline your business, we\u2019ve got you covered.\nWhat is a Channel Manager?\nA channel manager is an online platform that helps short-term rental hosts manage their listings across multiple booking channels. Using a channel manager allows property managers to connect all of their listings\u2014whether from online travel agencies (OTAs) or platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com,or Vrbo\u2014in one central location.\nAt its core, good channel managers act as a central hub for managing bookings, availability, and nightly rates in real time. This means that any updates or changes made to a listing will automatically be reflected on all of the connected channels. As a result, hosts and property managers won\u2019t have to make these updates across multiple platforms, and it minimizes the risk of double bookings.\nHow Can a Channel Manager Help Hosts?\nThe right channel manager saves time and increases efficiency by automating and centralizing the process of listing and managing properties across booking sites. Below, we explore the key ways in which the best channel manager systems can save hosts countless hours.\n1. Centralized booking management\nA channel manager allows hosts to manage all of their bookings across sales channels from a single dashboard. Reservations across multiple channels can be managed in one place, whether on Airbnb, Vrbo, or online travel agents.\nThis centralization eliminates the need to log into multiple sites to update calendars or adjust rates. Channel management software reduces the chance of human error in reservation management. Plus, with everything in one place, it saves hosts a ton of time!\n2. Automated updates and synchronization\nOne of the most challenging aspects of managing short-term rentals is keeping all listing information up-to-date across each platform. Channel manager software automates this process by synchronizing updates in real time.\nThis ensures that availability, prices, and details are consistent everywhere. Thereby, this easy-to-use automation reduces the host\u2019s workload and, again, prevents the dreaded double bookings from happening.\n3. Advanced reporting and insights\nHosts need access to accurate data to run a successful short-term rental business. Many channel managers offer custom reports that share your vacation rental\u2019s financial performance and occupancy rates. These analytics can help hosts make informed decisions about pricing, promotions, and how to tailor their offerings to meet market demands.\n4. Easily expand online distribution channels\nWith your property listed on more sites, you\u2019re naturally getting more eyes on your listings. The more places you can list your vacation rental, the better chance you have at securing bookings. A channel manager makes your online distribution strategy easier to manage.\nWhat is the Difference Between a Channel Manager and a Property Management System?\nWhile both channel managers and property management systems (PMS) are designed to assist in the management of rental properties, they serve different but complementary functions.\nA channel management system for vacation rentals primarily focuses on distributing and synchronizing your property listings across multiple booking platforms. It ensures that your availability, rates, and property information are up-to-date.\nOn the other hand, a property management system is a more comprehensive tool that includes features for managing every aspect of your rental business. This includes guest communication, cleaning schedules, and maintenance management, among others.\nIn essence, while a channel manager is an essential component for marketing and distributing your listings, a PMS offers a broader set of tools for the operational side of your rental business. For maximum efficiency, utilizing both a channel manager and a property management system can provide a valuable solution for effectively managing your short-term rental properties.\nCan you use a channel manager in the hotel industry?\nYou can certainly use a channel manager in the hotel industry. In fact, many hotels and resorts utilize hotel channel managers to distribute their hotel rooms across various booking platforms.\nWhat to Look for in a Channel Manager\nWhen selecting a channel manager for your hotel website or vacation rental property, it\u2019s important to consider a few key items. Of course, consider the unique needs of your specific business before deciding on a service. Here are a few important attributes to look for:\n\nSeamless Integration: Opt for a channel manager that offers easy integration with your existing property management system and other operational tools. This ensures a smooth flow of information and reduces the risk of overbookings.\nWide Distribution Network: A good channel manager should connect you with a broad range of booking sites. It should include major platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com, as well as niche markets specific to your property\u2019s location or type. The ability to accept direct bookings is also a plus.\nReal-time Synchronization: Real-time updates are crucial to managing bookings effectively. The channel manager should synchronize availability, rates, and bookings across all channels instantaneously.\nUser-friendly Interface: The system should have an intuitive and easy-to-navigate dashboard that allows you to manage your listings and view your performance metrics without hassle.\nSupport and Training: Adequate customer support and training resources are important to help you get the most out of the channel manager. Look for providers that offer reliable support services.\nReporting and Analytics: Access to detailed analytics and reporting tools can help you make informed decisions about your pricing strategy and channel performance.\n\n5 Examples of Great Channel Management Software\nThe following channel managers have been recognized for their exceptional functionality, user-friendly interfaces, and their ability to streamline the distribution process.

How Should an Investor Use It?\n\n\nContent: Real Estate Analysis\nGross Rent Multiplier: What Is It? How Should an Investor Use It?\n\nby Heba Baker\nPublished October 15, 2023Last updated November 3, 2023 \n\nPublished October 15, 2023Last updated November 3, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\nReal estate investments are tangible assets that can lose value for\u00a0many\u00a0reasons. Thus, it is important that you value an investment property before buying it in order to avoid any fallouts. Successful real estate investors use various valuation methods to value an investment property and these include Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), Capitalization Rate, Cash on Cash Return, among others. Each and every real estate valuation method analyzes the performance using different variables. For example, the cash on cash return measures the performance of the cash invested in an investment property ignoring and not accounting for a mortgage, per se. Capitalization rate, on the other hand, can be more beneficial for income generating or rental properties. This is because capitalization rate measures the rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the income that the property is expected to generate.\nWhat about the gross rent multiplier? And what is its significance in real estate investments?\nIn this article, we will explain what Gross Rent Multiplier is, its significance and limitations. To give you a better idea of Gross Rent Multiplier, we will compare it to another property valuation method, capitalization rate or \u201ccap rate.\u201d\nWhat Is Gross Rent Multiplier in Real Estate Investing?\nSimilar to other property valuation methods, Gross Rent Multiplier becomes effective when screening, valuing, and comparing investment properties. As opposed to other valuation methods, however, the Gross Rent Multiplier analyzes rental properties using only its gross income. It is the ratio of a property\u2019s price to gross rental income. Through top-line revenue, the Gross Rent Multiplier will tell you how many months or years it takes for an investment property to pay for itself.\nGRM\u00a0is calculated by dividing the fair market value or asking property price by the estimated annual gross rental income. The formula is:\nGRM= Price/Gross Annual Rent\nLet\u2019s take an example. Let\u2019s assume you aim to buy a rental property for $200,000 that will produce a monthly rental income of $2,300. Before we plug the numbers into the equation, we want to calculate the annual gross income. Beware! So, $2,300*12= $27,600. Now we have all the variables necessary for our equation.\nGross Rent Multiplier = Property Price/ Gross Annual Rent = $200,000/$27,600 = 7.25.\nThe Gross Rent Multiplier is thus 7.25. But what does that mean? The GRM can tell you how much rent you will collect relative to property price or cost and/or how much time it will take for your investment to pay for itself through rent. In our example, the real estate investor will have an 87-month ($200,000/$2,300) payoff ratio which translates into 7.25 years. That\u2019s the Gross Rent Multiplier!\nHow to Calculate Gross Rent Multiplier\nSo just how easy is it to actually calculate? According to the gross rent multiplier formula, it\u2019ll take you less than five minutes.\nGross Rent Multiplier = Property Price / Gross Rental Income\nLike we said, very straightforward and simple. There are only two variables included in the gross rent multiplier calculation. And they\u2019re fairly easy to find. If you haven\u2019t been able to determine the property price, you can use real estate comps to ballpark your building\u2019s potential price. Gross rental income only looks at a property\u2019s potential rent roll (expenses and vacancies\u00a0are not included) and is an annual figure, not monthly.\nThe GRM is also known as the gross rate multiplier or gross income multiplier. These titles are used when analyzing income properties with multiple sources of revenue. So for example, in addition to rent, the property also generates income from an onsite coin laundry.\nThe result of the GRM calculation gives you a multiple. The final figure represents how many times larger\u00a0the cost of the property is than the gross rent it will collect in a year.\n\nHow Investors Should Use GRM\nThere are two applications for gross rent multiplier- a screening tool and a valuation tool.\nThe first way to use it is in accordance with the original formula; if you know the property price and the rental rate, GRM can be a first quick value assessment tool. Because investors usually have multiple property listings on their radar, they need a quick way to determine which properties to focus on.\u00a0If the GRM is too high or too low compared to recent comparable sold properties, this can indicate a problem with the property or gross over-pricing.\nAnother way to use gross rent multiplier is to actually determine the property\u2019s price (market value). In this case, the value calculation would be:\nProperty Value= GRM x Gross Rental Income.\u00a0\nIf you know your area or local market\u2019s average GRM, you can use it in a property\u2019s valuation. Here\u2019s the gross rent multiplier by city for apartment rentals.\nSo the gross rent multiplier can be used as a filtering process to help you prioritize potential investments. Investors can also use it to estimate a ballpark property price. However, due to the simplicity of the GRM formula, it should not be used as a stand-alone tool. Actually, no one metric is capable of determining the value and profitability of a real estate investment. The real estate investing business just isn\u2019t that simple. You need to use a collection of different metrics and measures to accurately determine a property\u2019s return on investment. That\u2019s how you get a precise analysis to make the right investment decisions.\nWhat Is a Good Gross Rent Multiplier?\nTake a second to think about the actual gross rent multiplier formula. You\u2019re comparing the cost of the property to the revenue it\u2019ll generate. Rationally, you would want to aim for a higher income with a lower cost. So the ideal GRM would be a low number. Typically, a good GRM is somewhere between 4 and 7. The lower the GRM, the better the value- usually.\nYou need to keep in mind the property\u2019s condition. Is it in need of any renovations? Or are the operating expenses too much to handle? Maybe a cheap property that rents well won\u2019t perform as well in the long-term. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to properly analyze any property before buying it.\nIt\u2019s also not a universal figure; meaning real estate is a local industry and GRM is dynamic because rental income and property values are dynamic. So how can you quickly and easily find the appropriate figures for your investment property analysis?\nWhat Are the Pros and Cons of Using Gross Rent Multiplier?\nPros\n\nIt is easy to use.\nTo calculate the Gross Rent Multiplier, you need to account for gross rental income. Since rental income is market-driven, GRM makes a reliable real estate valuation method for comparing investment properties.\nIt makes an effective screening tool for potential properties: this tool allows you to compare and contrast several properties within a real estate market and conclude on a property with the most promise as far as price and rent collected.\n\nCons\n\nThe GRM fails to account for operating expenses. One investment property might have as high as 12 GRM, however, incurs minimal costs, while another investment property might have a GRM of 5 and has incurred costs to exceed 5% of property price. Note that older properties might sell for lower and thus have a lower GRM. However, they tend to have higher expenses. Therefore, when accounting for expenses, the number of years to pay back the property price will be higher. Because the GRM considers only the gross income, GRM fails to differentiate investment properties with lower or higher operating expenses.\nThe GRM does not account for insurance nor property tax. You might have two properties with the same property price and rental income but different insurance and property tax. This means that when accounting for insurance and property tax, the amount of time to pay off property price will be higher than the GRM.\nSince the Gross Rent Multiplier uses only gross scheduled rents as opposed to net income, it fails to enumerate and calculate for vacancies. All investment properties are expected to have vacancies; in fact, poorer performing real estate investments tend to have higher vacancy rates. It is important that real estate investors differentiate between what an investment property can bring in and what it actually generates, of which GRM does not account for.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between Cap Rate and Gross Rent Multiplier?\nMany real estate investors confuse cap rate and GRM. We will sort this out for you. First and foremost, the cap rate is based on the net operating income rather than the gross scheduled income as calculated in GRM. So for the cap rate equation, instead of dividing property price by top-line revenue as done in the GRM measurement, we divide net operating income (NOI) by\u00a0property price. What is different in the cap rate from GRM is that cap rate takes into account most of the operating expenses including repairs, utilities, and upgrades. Some real estate investors might think that cap rate makes a better indicator of the performance of an investment property. However, note that often times expenses can be manipulated, as it might be difficult to estimate a property\u2019s operating expenses. Therefore, we can conclude the cap rate is more difficult to verify as opposed to GRM.\nTo sum up, the Gross Rent Multiplier is\u00a0a real estate valuation method\u00a0to assist you when screening for potential investment properties. It is a good rule of thumb to help you analyze a property and select from potential real estate investments.\u00a0Keep in mind that the GRM does not account for operating expenses, vacancies, and insurance and taxes. Make sure to factor these expenses in your investment property analysis. For more information about Gross Rent Multiplier or other valuation methods, visit Mashvisor.

We regularly give you useful investment information and advice, especially on the best locations for investment property.\u00a0\nThat being said, this article will show you which places are worth checking out for both long and short term rental properties in 2023. More than just showing you excellent investment locations, we will also give you a few tips on staying ahead of the real estate investing game.\u00a0\nSo if you\u2019re in the market looking for the best place to buy a rental property in 2023, keep reading.\nCharacteristics of Best Places to Invest in Real Estate\nWhen looking for a great location to invest in rental properties, the first step should be learning how to identify what characteristics the best place to invest in real estate in 2023 demonstrates.\u00a0\nRemember, you can always change some of your property\u2019s features and carry out major upgrades and renovations, but you\u2019re stuck with your investment location until you decide to offload your investment. This is why you must choose your location carefully.\nMost real estate investors have their own criteria when looking for cities to invest in. But investing in the fastest growing city isn\u2019t enough.\nLet\u2019s look at common characteristics of suitable locations for both long and short term rental locations:\nLong Term Rental Locations\nHere are some characteristics of great locations for long term rental properties:\nLow Unemployment Rate\nRental properties are profitable when you invest in locations where the residents can afford to pay rent. Great investment locations for rental properties have high employment and job growth rates.\u00a0\nSeek to understand the number of big employers in a city you\u2019re interested in. Avoid investing in a place with only one big employer. What could happen to your investment if the only employer in your area shut down or moved operations to another city?\nMany employers mean that the city\u2019s economy is booming. It also means that the local population can find employment fast and earn a consistent income to pay their bills.\nBasically, consider the following factors when looking for a city with low unemployment rates:\n\nJob growth rate\nMedian salary\nTypes of jobs available\nNumber of large employers\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not many cities tick all the boxes. Find a location that offers a perfect balance of all the factors.\nYour best bet is with a city whose unemployment rate is lower than the national average.\nHigh Appreciation Rates\nThere are many ways to measure a property\u2019s profitability. One common way is estimating how much cash flow the property will give you every month. The other way that\u2019s often overlooked is the property\u2019s value appreciation in the long term.\nMany factors influence a property\u2019s appreciation rate. Some of them have to do with the property itself. They include the property\u2019 size, age, condition, features, upgrades, and renovations.\nThe other factors, which are the most important ones, are determined by the location. For example, a property located in a high-growth area with a lot of upcoming developments will experience a higher appreciation rate compared to properties in dormant cities.\nSome factors specific to the neighborhood also determine whether your property appreciates. Properties in a secure neighborhood will appreciate more than properties in an area with high crime rates.\nAs you can tell, the best places to buy rental property in 2023 have high property appreciation rates.\nPopulation Growth\nAn excellent location for buying investment property experiences a good population growth rate through both natural growth and immigration.\u00a0\nConsider a city\u2019s population and look at whether it\u2019s growing or declining before investing. A growing population means that demand for housing will increase.\u00a0\nPopulation growth is intertwined with low unemployment. Cities with the availability of jobs experience immigration as people from other states and cities move in to look for opportunities. Those who succeed settle in the city and look for housing.\nOther factors influencing population growth include good weather, friendly government policies, and affordable cost of living.\nLow Housing Supply & High Demand\nThe best places to buy investment property in 2023 have a low supply of rental properties but a high demand. Purchasing a rental property in such a location means you get to experience low tenant turnover and high rental rates since competition is low.\nKeep in mind that while a city may have a low supply of rental properties now, there may be upcoming developments that change the situation in the near future.\nAlso, a low housing supply doesn\u2019t necessarily give you the green light to invest in the city. There may be other factors that make the location less desirable for investment.\nFind a city with a perfect balance between low supply and high demand for housing.\nModerate Price-to-Rent Ratio\nThere are many metrics to consider before investing in any location. One of them is the price-to-rent ratio.\nSimply put, the price-to-rent ratio tells you whether it\u2019s ideal to buy or rent in a particular market. A low ratio means people would prefer buying to renting. A high ratio means that property buying prices are higher than rental rates, so residents would prefer renting.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of different price-to-rent ratios and what they mean:\n\n1-15: Buying a property is better than renting\n16-20: There\u2019s a balance between home prices and rental rates\n21+: Renting may be better compared to invest in rental properties\n\nWhile a high ratio may mean your rental property will experience increased demand, be careful with locations with ratios that are too high. When property prices are incredibly high, it\u2019ll take a long time to recoup your investment.\nAvailability of Amenities\nTraditional amenities boost a rental property\u2019s appeal, demand, and, ultimately, return on investment. Cities that make for great investment locations have good schools, parks, grocery stores, restaurants, health facilities, and other amenities that boost residents\u2019 convenience.\u00a0\nThese amenities can also influence your target tenants. If you\u2019re investing in a college town, you can use your investment as a student rental.\nPublic Transport\nGreat locations for rental property investment are easily accessible either by air or by road. A central transportation hub is an asset when looking for a good location to invest in.\nGood transportation hubs provide easier access to the city center, commercial and residential areas, other cities, and amenities. It is a huge plus for residents who commute to and from work and school, as well as those who prioritize entertainment.\nShort Term Rental Locations\nWhat should you look out for if you\u2019re interested in short term rental properties? Here are some characteristics of great locations for these investments:\nTourist Attractions\nThe short term rental industry is highly dependent on the tourism industry. Great short term rental locations are near popular tourist attractions.\u00a0\nThink of cities near national parks, mountains, lakes, beaches, hiking trails, wildlife sanctuaries, amusement parks, and basically anything that would attract outdoor lovers.\nDon\u2019t forget cultural and historical attractions, such as museums, archaeological treasures, landmarks, religious venues, monuments, and science centers.\nAs an Airbnb host, you should find out what your guests are attracted to in your city and tailor your short term rental to suit them.\nFavorable Airbnb Regulations\nOne of the most important characteristics of good locations for short term rental investment is favorable short term rental laws and regulations. Seek to find out whether your city has Airbnb ordinances, what you\u2019re required to do to operate an Airbnb legally, and the legal implications of not adhering.\nAirbnb regulations vary from city to city. Some local authorities have banned Airbnb rentals in their cities, while others have strict rules that hosts must adhere to. Others have a limit on the number of guests you can host and the maximum number of nights you can lease out your property as an Airbnb rental in a year.\nSeek to find out what permits, licenses, permits, taxes, and zoning regulations you\u2019ll have to abide by.\nOther than the local authority regulations, seek to find out whether there could be any limits specific to your neighborhood. Some Homeowners Associations (HOAs) have their own custom regulations that hosts must comply with.\nBe aware of any developing legislation that may affect your short term rental down the line.\n\u00a0\n Discover Top Investment Locations\n\u00a0\n20 Best Places to Invest in Real Estate for Long Term Rentals in 2023\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy an investment property in the US, here are 20 of the best places for purchasing investment properties for long term rentals, based on Mashvisor\u2019s May 2023 location report.\nWe selected the cities based on the following criteria:\u00a0\n\nEach market has a median property price below $1,000,000\nEach market has no less than 100 active listings\nEach market has at least $2,000 in monthly rental income\nEach market has a cash on cash return of 2.00% or higher\nEach market has a price to rent ratio of 20 and above\n\nThe following list includes the 20 best cities to invest in real estate in 2023 and towns that rank high on all of the criteria above, which should give you some ideas about where to invest in real estate in 2023.

However, it can be difficult to find the best market for real estate investors, especially when considering numerous cities.\nA few considerations when buying investment properties:\n\nLocation of the property \u2013 You want to buy an investment property close enough to where you live so that you can visit it often but also far enough away. If something happens, it will not affect you too much. Out-of-town investments can also be considered but should be given plenty of thought.\u00a0\nPrice of the property \u2013 You want to buy a property with great potential for appreciation, especially if you don\u2019t plan to sell it any time soon.\nCash flow \u2013 You want your return on investment after expenses (cash on cash return) to be as high as possible, considering the upkeep and other costs associated with rental properties.\n\nInvesting With Mashvisor\nInvestment properties are a great way to make money.

This is why real estate investing may be a bit difficult for beginners at first.\u00a0\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated. That\u2019s why Mashvisor is here.\nHere are a few tips to help you have a seamless journey even when you\u2019re new to real estate investing:\nResearch, Research, and More Research!\nInformation has always been, and will always be, power. Having the correct information will give you a huge advantage over other investors. Seek to carry out in-depth research on all aspects of real estate investing.\nOn top of carrying out market research to spot profitable housing markets within your reach, you must also dive deep to spot any hidden investment opportunities. Sometimes, your perception may be different from the realities on the ground.\nYou can spot some great off-market properties or distressed sellers willing to let go of their properties for a lower price. Your research can lead you to property sellers who want to sell but have not publicly listed the well-maintained properties yet.\nYour research will also help you identify which property type has more demand in your market. And speaking of property types\u2026\nChoose a Property Type\nThere are various types of property you have to choose from. The ideal property type depends on a few factors, such as housing demand and population demographics in your market.\nFor example, it makes more sense to invest in a condo or apartment unit in a college town. If working professionals with families make up the majority of your city\u2019s population, it makes more sense to invest in single-family homes or multi-family units.\nThe key is to always keep your tenants in mind.\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen an ideal property type, think of the optimal rental strategy. Different markets are suitable for different rental strategies.\nFor example, a tourist city with major attractions with many tourists flocking in is ideal for a short term rental strategy. A city with many industries is perfect for long term rentals since the workers need a place to stay.\nIf your ideal market is a major commercial hub, you can also forego residential real estate in favor of commercial properties. Commercial properties include office buildings, shopping malls, warehouses, assembly plants, and many others.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that commercial real estate is a different ball game compared to residential real estate. Again, carry out in-depth research to understand which of the two works best.\nUnderstand the Financial Implications\nQuite honestly, real estate investments aren\u2019t cheap. While it can be profitable in the long run, properties require a significant investment upfront. It\u2019s important to determine where you stand financially and whether you can afford to buy in cash or you\u2019ll seek financing.\nAnd investing in properties isn\u2019t as simple as purchasing and watching the investment bring your monthly income. Other additional costs include property taxes, insurance, maintenance, upgrades, and other expenses.\nThe expenses may become even higher if you choose to invest in a short term rental. It is because you have to furnish the property to appeal to guests, provide utilities such as Wi-Fi, and clean the property every time a guest checks out.\nIf you\u2019re taking out a loan, remember you\u2019ll have to repay the loan to avoid foreclosure. Seek to understand how much money you\u2019ll have to set aside for mortgage repayment every month.\u00a0\nBe careful not to go for something you can\u2019t afford. Don\u2019t be overambitious. You can always find a real estate investment within your budget.\nBuild a Team\nTo most people, investing is a way to secure their future and build wealth for the next generation. It is why it\u2019s important to build a team of various real estate professionals to hold your hand and ensure you get it right.\nFirstly you need to get a mentor who\u2019ll show you the ropes and teach you common pitfalls to avoid. Your mentor should be someone who\u2019s successful in the real estate strategy you\u2019re interested in.\u00a0\nAfter that, get a real estate agent experienced in your local market. This agent should understand your market well so that they can help you comb the market for affordable and profitable deals. They should have vast networks so they can find off-market properties to save you money.\nAlso, get a real estate attorney who\u2019ll walk you through the legal aspects of real estate transactions. These professionals are also important when writing contracts and protecting yourself from potential scams.\nOther important professionals to know include contractors and suppliers, especially if you\u2019re interested in fix-and-flip. These professionals also come in handy when carrying out any upgrades or renovations to your home.\nDon\u2019t forget to network with other real estate investors as well.\nThink Long Term\nOne of the most important things you\u2019ll do as a real estate investor is to shift your mindset and start thinking like a business person. Your mindset will significantly impact your success.\nFor example, an abundance mindset will push you to seek opportunities in every situation and compel you to seek results proactively.\nIf you\u2019re a beginner investor, know that adapting this mindset and polishing it will take time. It is why you need to think long term.\nFor example, you need to buy your properties with growth in mind. Every investor wants to offload their properties for a higher price than they purchased them. With this in mind, you\u2019ll make minor upgrades and additions to your property over time to maximize the property\u2019s value.\nAlso, develop a long term business plan to keep you in check. A business plan helps you focus on the bigger picture and avoid distractions from minor setbacks.\nWrapping It Up\nGoing into 2023, you must keep your eyes peeled for the most profitable investment opportunities. Knowing the best places to invest in real estate as early as now will give you an edge over the competition.\u00a0\nIt also helps if you use the best tools that will help you make accurate ROI projections so you don\u2019t experience buyer\u2019s remorse. Mashvisor will give you access to the best investment tools available out there today. Its tools are guaranteed to help you find the best deals on rental properties that fit your budget and match your needs.\u00a0\nMashvisor will also give you access to up-to-date, high-quality data to make calculations and projections as accurate and realistic as possible.\u00a0\nTo get access to Mashvisor\u2019s real estate investing tools and data, sign up for a 7-day free trial now, followed by a 15% lifetime discount.\n\n\nStart Your Investment Property Search!    \n\nSTART FREE TRIAL\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n0 FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Post\n\n\n\nThe Best Real Estate Data API for 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Post\n\n\n\nWill There Be a Real Estate Housing Market Correction in 2023?\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated Posts\n\n\n\n\n6 Tampa Housing Market Forecast 2023\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Rental App for Real Estate Investors?\n\n\n\n\nShould You Be Buying Atlanta Investment Properties for Sale in 2018?\n\n\n\n\n4 Main Property Valuation Methods for Real Estate Investors\n\n\n\n\nHow to Perform a Real Estate Market Analysis\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use the 50% Rule to Find Cash Flow Properties\n\n\n\n\nHow to Calculate the Occupancy Rate for Rental Properties\n\n\n\n\nMashvisor Success Story: Here\u2019s How Mashvisor Worked Its Magic on This Real Estate Investor\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cHow To\u201d Guide of Performing a Comparative Market Analysis\n\n\n\n\nHow to Value an Investment Property\n\n\n\n\nThe Different Questions to Consider When Evaluating Real Estate\n\n\n\n\nHow Do You Conduct Residential Property Market Analysis?"}

Experts are optimistic that they will go down as the economy recovers.\n\n\n\n\nAs we enter Q2 2023, a lot of investors are curious to read about the latest US housing market news to see what\u2019s in store for them this year.\n\nQ1 2023 was somehow kinder to a lot of investors and homebuyers, as we saw slightly lower rates and cooling markets. It gave us all a breather from 2022\u2019s wild ride when property prices soared and mortgage rates went through the roof.\u00a0\nIn this news article, we will talk about what investors can look forward to in April and, hopefully, give them ideas on how to go about with real estate investing.\u00a0\nHousing Inventory: What Are the Latest Numbers?\nFor the latest US housing market news, let\u2019s talk about the housing supply first. While inventory remained steady at the 980,000\u2019s level from January 2023 to February 2023, it went up by at least 30,000 units compared to March 2022 figure. Housing inventory data for March 2023 is not yet available at the time of writing.\u00a0\nAdditionally, Forbes\u2019s updated news report states that housing starts went up 9.8% in February, giving us additional inventory. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Realtors Association (NAR), said that the national housing inventory is still at historic lows. He added: \n\u201cConsequently, multiple offers are returning on a good number of properties.\u201d\nExisting inventory is still below levels seen before the 2008 housing market crash. It looks like 2023 will pretty much be the same. It is because declining mortgage rates and cooling markets are bringing back borrowers and buyers into real estate investing.\u00a0\nCurrently, unsold inventory is at a 2.6-month supply, up slightly from 1.6 months a year ago.\u00a0\nHowever, US News also reports that 600,000 new apartments will be added to the market in 2023. Earlier in January, around 563,000 multifamily building permits were issued, according to the US Census Bureau.\u00a0\u00a0\n10 US Markets With the Most Listings as of March 2023\nReal estate website Mashvisor gives us an idea of the housing supply in the US in its March 2023 market data. According to the website, the following locations reported the highest number of listings on the market: \n\nNew York City, NY: 4,312\nMiami, FL: 3,954\nLas Vegas, NV: 3,950\nSan Antonio, TX: 3,890\nChicago, IL 3,194\nAtlanta, GA: 3,146\nPhiladelphia, PA: 2,780\nCape Coral, FL: 2,390\nDallas, TX: 2,336\nTampa, FL: 2,295\n\nProperty Prices: How Much Do Houses Cost Nowadays?\nFor more US housing market news, it seems that most real estate markets are still cooling down in the US. According to the NAR, in February 2023, the median home sales price went down 2% year-over-year. The decrease brought an end to the 131-month year-over-year increases.\nNow just because markets are cooling down (meaning the increase rates aren\u2019t as high as they used to be), the tight inventory is also keeping prices from going down. As a result, housing affordability remains far from the reach of many homebuyers and real estate investors. Many of those who were able to buy properties at historically low mortgage rates are staying put for now.\u00a0\nThe good news is that while home prices aren\u2019t dropping dramatically any time soon, they aren\u2019t as insanely high as the rates were in early 2022. As far as home prices going down, it will largely depend on where mortgage rates go in the coming months.\u00a0\n10 Most Affordable Real Estate Markets in the US as of March 2023\nAccording to Mashvisor\u2019s March 2023 market data, the markets with the most affordable investment properties are the following:\n\nSmith, PA: $71,580\nChristopher, IL: $73,660\nClaysburg, PA: $77,822\nMonessen, PA: $92,217\nWood River, IL: $92,988\nParsons, KS: $96,466\nHampton, IA: $97,950\nCentralia, IL: $100,850\nHighland Park, MI: $101,057\nRock Falls, IL: $102,450\n\nApril Mortgage Rates: What\u2019s in Store for the US Market\nOne of the biggest questions in the minds of most investors and buyers is how much are mortgage rates today. Most folks are keeping their eyes on the US housing market news hoping that mortgage rates will drop in the current quarter.\u00a0\nSo far, the first quarter\u2019s mortgage rates steadily moved within the 6.30% to 7.15% range. The lowest rate for a 30-year fixed was 6.36% for weeks three and five. We saw a peak of 7.13% just a few weeks ago during the week of March 10, 2023.\u00a0\nAccording to Bankrate, the mortgage rates at the time of writing are the following:\u00a0\n\n30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.81%\u00a0\n15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.12%\u00a0\n10-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.31%\n30-year refinance: 6.97%\u00a0\n5-1 ARM: 5.72%\n\nNow, as far as the second quarter and the rest of the year are concerned, industry insiders and experts offer slightly different opinions, as reported by Norada.\u00a0\nGenerally, nearly everyone is optimistic that mortgage rates will continue to go down as the US economy slows. Lawrence Yun anticipates rates to go as low as 5.5% by the middle of the year. On the other hand, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both predict rates to reach 6.8% and 6.4%, respectively, in 2023.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) also expects rates to fall in 2023 as its economists predict that the US will enter a recession during the first half of the year. According to the group, rates for 2023 will conclude at about 5.4%.\nLong Term Rental Market Updates for April 2023\nLong term rentals are an investment strategy adopted by many investors to give them a steady monthly income. As of mid-March 2023, the average national rent clocks in at $1,976, a 0.5% increase over the past six months. The annual rent growth rate is also down by nearly 10% year-over-year, according to a US News rental housing market report.\nThe same report quotes RentSpree\u2019s CEO Michael Lucarelli: \n\u201cLandlords will likely begin to minimize rent increases to prevent tenants from leaving. This can also give renters far more negotiating power than before.\u201d \nThe downward trend in rental rates can be attributed to two main factors: the slight increase in housing supply and the easing of economic challenges.\u00a0\nTop 5 US Markets for Long Term Rentals in April 2023\nWe accessed Mashvisor\u2019s March 2023 data to give you the top five markets for long term rentals in April. The following list is ranked from the highest to lowest cash on cash return on long term rentals and is filtered using the following criteria:\u00a0\n\nEach location must have a maximum median property price of $1,000,000;\u00a0\nEach location should have no less than 100 active listings on the long term rental market;\nEach location must have a minimum monthly rental income of $2,000;\nEach location should offer at least a 2.00% cash on cash return; and\nEach location must have a price to rent ratio of 20 and above.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re looking for a good location for long term rental property investments in April 2023, consider the areas below:\n\n1.

But just like the long term rental market, the vacation rental industry is also impacted by inventory, home prices, and mortgage rates. The said factors weigh down investors, but some continue to make investments because of the profit potential offered by short term rentals.\u00a0\nWith the pandemic\u2019s social impacts carrying over to the post-COVID era, people make more time to travel as a lot of them fully embrace remote work. And instead of limiting their visits to familiar places, they are venturing out into new locations.\u00a0\nAnother thing to note is that guests are leaning more towards contactless stays compared to more personal human interaction. It means that short term rental owners who want to up their game should consider incorporating more technology into their Airbnb business.\u00a0\nThe same goes for those looking to start a rental property business and getting them listed on vacation rental platforms.\u00a0\nIt is also important to note that there is an increasing demand for vacation rentals that allow for longer stays.\u00a0\nTop 5 US Markets for Short Term Rentals in April 2023\nSimilar to our list of long term rental markets, we\u2019re giving you five of the best real estate markets for vacation rentals using Mashvisor\u2019s March 2023 short term rental data.\nThis list is ranked from highest to lowest short term rental cash on cash return and is filtered using the following criteria:\u00a0\n\nEach location must have a median property price that will not exceed $1,000,000;\u00a0\nEach location must have a minimum of 100 active listings on the short term rental market;\u00a0\nEach location must offer a monthly rental income of $2,000 and above;\u00a0\nEach location must have a short term cash on cash return of 2.00% or more; and\nEach location must have an occupancy rate of no less than 50%.\n\nHere are the top five locations for short term rental property investments based on Mashvisor\u2019s latest report:\n\n1.

If you\u2019re considering adding solar to your home, or you\u2019re dealing with a property that has solar panels, this information could save you a lot of headaches and money. I have bought many houses with solar and I have run into many issues that many people have no idea about. \nTable of ContentsVideo: The Hidden Costs of SolarThe Foreclosure Solar FiascoThe Hidden Costs of Solar SystemsReplacing Roofs with Solar PanelsSolar Makes Selling DifficultKey Takeaways for Homeowners\nVideo: The Hidden Costs of Solar\n\n\n\nThe Foreclosure Solar Fiasco\nRecently, I bought a foreclosure property at an auction. The winning bid was $249,000, which was lower than expected, possibly because the house had a solar system. Here\u2019s where things got tricky. The title company refused to insure the house due to a $38,000 lien on the solar system. The previous owners owed this amount, and the lien survived the foreclosure.\nThis almost cost me the deal and my $122,000 earnest money deposit. Thankfully, my title company confirmed that the lien was against the equipment, not the property. So, the solar company could technically reclaim their equipment, which was fine by me as long as I kept the house.\n\nHow to buy a foreclosure\nThe Hidden Costs of Solar Systems\nMany people think solar systems are a great deal because they reduce electricity bills. However, these systems are not free. You\u2019re often taking on significant debt that affects your debt-to-income ratio, making it harder to buy another house. If the system is leased, the new buyer might have to qualify for the lease, or you might need to pay off the system before selling the house. In my case, this amounted to nearly $40,000.\nReplacing Roofs with Solar Panels\nIn another deal, I had to replace the roof on a house flip. The house had solar panels, and removing and reinstalling them cost an additional $5,000. This wasn\u2019t covered by insurance, which only added to the overall expense. Furthermore, insurance premiums might increase due to the extra cost associated with solar panel maintenance.\nSolar Makes Selling Difficult\nI\u2019ve come across several interesting stories involving solar panels. For instance, a property listed for sale had a $99,500 lease transfer fee for the solar system. This fee could deter potential buyers and complicate the sale.\nOn other deals, the buyers needed to qualify for both the home loan and to take over the solar panel lease. While they were able to qualify for the house, they weren\u2019t able to also qualify for the solar lease. Both together pushed above their limits. In these cases, either the seller needs to pay off the solar panels completely or the buyer needs to terminate.\nUltimately, when there\u2019s a solar lease, the buyer\u2019s \u201cbuying power\u201d is reduced by the amount of the lease, which can be very substantial. In many cases, buyers will quickly learn they can get much more house for their money by avoiding ones with solar panels.\nIf you\u2019re looking to add value to your house, instead of going solar, see my article: What Remodel Projects Add the Most Value to a House?\nKey Takeaways for Homeowners\n\nIt\u2019s Not Free: Understand that installing solar panels often means taking on significant debt. This debt doesn\u2019t disappear if you sell the house or face foreclosure.\nPotential Selling Issues: If the solar system is leased, the new buyer might need to qualify for the lease, or you might have to pay it off before selling.\nHigher Insurance Costs: Solar panels can increase your insurance premiums and might not be fully covered in case of damage.\nHidden Fees: Be aware of possible lease transfer fees, which can be prohibitively expensive.\nMaintenance Costs: Replacing roofs or dealing with panel damage can incur additional costs.\nDue Diligence: Always ask about the potential implications of selling or refinancing a house with solar panels.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about installing solar panels or buying a house with them, make sure you understand all the potential costs and complications. The savings on your electricity bill might not be worth the financial headaches.\nWhat\u2019s your experience with solar panels?\nLet me know in the comments below.

In this post, I\u2019ll discuss the pros and cons for landlords and tenants. This topic is often misunderstood, with many believing landlords are against the idea to keep tenants from building good credit. \nIn reality, landlords might benefit from this more than tenants, while the implications for tenants can be complex and sometimes detrimental. Let\u2019s dive in.\nTable of ContentsVideo OverviewThe Current State of Rent ReportingThe Pros and Cons for LandlordsThe Pros and Cons for TenantsLegal and Practical ConsiderationsHow to Report Rent PaymentsConclusion\nVideo Overview\n\n\n\nThe Current State of Rent Reporting\nRent payments are not typically reported to credit bureaus. Some property management companies and national property management software providers do report rent, but it\u2019s not widespread. As a landlord, I have reviewed many tenant credit reports and rarely, if ever, see late rent payments reported. Instead, credit issues related to rent usually show up as judgments or evictions, which are public records.\n\nWhat is the Best Way to Screen Tenants for Rentals?\nThe Pros and Cons for Landlords\nPros:\n\nBetter Tenant Screening: Reporting rent payments could help landlords identify reliable tenants who pay on time, thus reducing the risk of late payments and potential evictions.\nIncentivizes Timely Payments: Knowing that late or missed rent payments will affect their credit scores, tenants might be more motivated to pay on time.\nImproved Tenant Credit: For tenants who consistently pay on time, rent reporting can help build their credit history, potentially aiding them in future financial endeavors such as buying a home.\n\nCons:\n\nCost: Some rent reporting services charge fees to landlords, which can add up over time.\nAdministrative Burden: Setting up and managing rent reporting requires additional time and effort from landlords.\nTenant Pushback: Tenants who are concerned about the impact of potential late payments on their credit might resist renting properties where rent is reported.\n\nThe Pros and Cons for Tenants\nPros:\n\nCredit Building: Regular, on-time rent payments can help tenants build or improve their credit scores, making it easier to secure loans or credit in the future.\nFinancial Accountability: Knowing their rent payments are being reported might encourage tenants to budget more effectively and prioritize timely payments.\n\nCons:\n\nRisk of Negative Impact: Late or missed rent payments could significantly damage a tenant\u2019s credit score, making it harder to secure future housing or loans.\nIncreased Scrutiny: Tenants with less-than-perfect payment histories might struggle to find landlords willing to rent to them if rent reporting becomes widespread.\n\nLegal and Practical Considerations\nBefore landlords start reporting rent payments, they must consider the legal implications and ensure they comply with local laws. Some states have stringent tenant protection laws that could impact the ability to report rent payments. For example, in Colorado, landlords cannot check credit reports if the tenant\u2019s rent is entirely paid by public assistance. Always consult with a legal professional to navigate these complexities.\nShould you use a property manager?\nHow to Report Rent Payments\nSeveral services facilitate rent reporting for both landlords and tenants. These include:\n\nExperian Boost: Tenants can add their rent payments, as well as utility, cell phone, and streaming service payments, to their credit reports through Experian Boost.\nRentTrack: This service reports to Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, and can include past rental payments for an additional fee.\nClearNow: Tenants pay rent through a portal, which then reports the payments to Experian.\n\nWhat is the best way to manage rentals?\nConclusion\nReporting rent payments to credit bureaus has potential benefits for both landlords and tenants. But it also carries significant risks. It is crucial to weigh these pros and cons carefully and consider the specific legal context in your state. For landlords, this could mean better tenant screening and incentivizing timely payments, but it also comes with costs and administrative challenges. For tenants, it could help build credit but also pose risks if payments are late.\nAs an experienced real estate investor and landlord, I see the value in rent reporting but also understand the potential downsides. It\u2019s a complex issue that requires careful consideration and legal guidance.\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this topic. Should rent payments be automatically reported to credit bureaus? Should it be a choice left to landlords and tenants?

In this post, I will cover the details of post-occupancy agreements and pre-occupancy agreements. I\u2019ll also dive into a particularly challenging real estate experience I personally had. While this ordeal brought significant attention to my YouTube channel, it highlighted the many pitfalls associated with these agreements. \nI\u2019ll also touch on pre-occupancy agreements and the evolving real estate and tenant laws that make these situations increasingly complex.\nTable of ContentsVideo: Post-Occupancy Risk \u2013 Horror StoriesMy Personal Post-Occupancy Agreement NightmareWhy Post-Occupancy Agreements Are RiskyPre-Occupancy Agreements: Equally TroublesomeReal-Life ConsequencesPractical Advice for Home Buyers and SellersConclusion\nVideo: Post-Occupancy Risk \u2013 Horror Stories\n\n\n\nMy Personal Post-Occupancy Agreement Nightmare\nA year ago, I purchased a property with a post-occupancy agreement, allowing the seller to remain in the house for 15 days after closing. If they stayed beyond that period, they owed $250 per day, with $5,000 held back from their proceeds to cover potential overstay penalties. Despite these precautions, the experience turned out to be a nightmare.\n\nThe seller repeatedly promised to move out \u201ctomorrow,\u201d stretching their stay and complicating the situation further. Although I eventually gained possession, it took nearly the entire $5,000 reserve to cover the extra days they stayed. The title company held the disputed amount for a year before it was finally released to me, marking the end of a stressful and drawn-out process.\nWhy Post-Occupancy Agreements Are Risky\nFor regular home buyers and sellers, post-occupancy agreements can be disastrous. If a seller refuses to leave, the buyer must follow state eviction guidelines, which can take months or even years in some states. This delay can cause significant financial strain, especially if the buyer needs to move in immediately or faces double housing costs.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that no matter how nice or trustworthy a seller seems, the risks remain. Some people are adept at exploiting these situations, knowing how to manipulate the system to their advantage. Always negotiate to hold back a substantial amount of money\u2014at least $10,000 or more, depending on the property\u2019s value\u2014to incentivize the seller to vacate promptly.\nHow Evictions Work and How to Avoid Them as a Landlord\nPre-Occupancy Agreements: Equally Troublesome\nPre-occupancy agreements, where buyers move in before the sale is finalized, can be just as problematic. If the sale falls through, buyers who have already moved in might refuse to leave, leading to similar eviction challenges. Even allowing buyers to store items in the garage can grant them possession rights, complicating the eviction process.\nAs a real estate agent and broker with over 20 years of experience, I always advise clients to avoid both pre- and post-occupancy agreements whenever possible. The convenience they offer is rarely worth the potential legal and financial headaches.\nReal-Life Consequences\nIn my case, the post-occupancy agreement allowed me to use the situation to my advantage on social media, but the average home buyer or seller doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Evictions are time-consuming and costly, involving legal fees, potential property damage, and lost rental income. The emotional toll and financial burden can be overwhelming.\nPractical Advice for Home Buyers and Sellers\nIf you must enter into a post-occupancy agreement, ensure it is written in your favor:\n\nHold back a substantial amount of money to incentivize the seller to vacate.\nSet a strict per-day penalty that accumulates significantly if the seller overstays.\nConsult with a lawyer to understand your rights and obligations fully.\n\nFor pre-occupancy agreements, avoid them if possible. If absolutely necessary, ensure clear terms are set, including a substantial security deposit and written agreements outlining the consequences of a deal falling through.\n\nMy Master the Deal course covers the many other ways you can find a great deal.\nConclusion\nWhile I continue to deal with post-occupancy agreements as an experienced investor, I approach them with caution and a clear strategy to mitigate risks. For most home buyers and sellers, the best advice is to avoid these agreements to prevent potential nightmares.\nLook for the best way to invest in real estate?

However, it\u2019s a misconception. We\u2019ve acquired numerous properties through the MLS, including one notable deal featuring a basement skatepark. Owner-occupants can leverage the MLS to their advantage, especially during exclusive bid periods like those for HUD homes.\n\nThe MLS is for real estate agents, but don\u2019t let that stop you. You can either:\n\nWork with an agent to help you find deals.\nUse the consumer version of your local MLS. Most MLS systems have a consumer-facing version. For example, my local MLS is IRES, but they have a non-agent-facing version at coloproperty.com.\n\nWholesale Deals\nWholesalers offer a treasure trove of off-market properties ripe for investment. While these deals lack the scrutiny of inspections and appraisals, they demand quick action and thorough due diligence. Learn how to discern between lucrative opportunities and potential pitfalls when engaging with wholesalers.\nFor more, read my wholesaling article.\nNetworking\nNetworking isn\u2019t just for job seekers; it\u2019s a potent tool for real estate enthusiasts. By fostering relationships with industry professionals, from lenders to fellow investors, you can be made aware of deals. This one may be as simple as telling everyone you know that you\u2019re in the market to buy real estate.\nOur recent townhouse flip stemmed from a banking connection, underscoring the value of a solid network.\nFor more, check out my post about real estate investor associations and clubs. \nDirect Marketing\nDirect marketing entails proactive outreach to homeowners considering selling their properties. Postcards, bandit signs, and digital ads are just a few avenues for connecting with motivated sellers. While it requires persistence and patience, this approach can yield remarkable results, as evidenced by our success stories.\nRead my article on direct marketing.\nAuctions\nAuction houses present a unique avenue for acquiring distressed properties at competitive prices. However, they come with inherent risks, such as limited visibility and stringent bidding conditions. Discover how we\u2019ve navigated the complexities of auction purchases and capitalized on favorable market conditions.\nRead my post about foreclosures and auctions.\nEducation and Resources\nAbove all, education is the most important. If you\u2019re not actively studying, you may be throwing away lots of time and money. \nInvesting in comprehensive courses, like those offered on our platform, equips you with the knowledge and tools needed to thrive in the real estate arena. From deal-finding strategies to financing insights, these resources empower you to make informed decisions and navigate challenges effectively.\nMy Master the Deal course walks you through everything you need to know to start finding great real estate investment deals. \nSpecial note: Master the Deal is on sale now!

That happened to me and it was not a fun time. Luckily it provided some great content for my YouTube channel which helped offset the cost of those squatters. I was also fortunate that I did not have to deal with the squatters for years or even more than 6 months as many people do. How long it takes to get rid of squatters can depend on the state, county, or town you reside in. While I was able to get rid of the squatters, I could have done a few things differently that may have forced them out sooner.\nTable of ContentsHow did I get squatters?The eviction hearingAnother eviction hearingHow to get squatters outConclusion\nHow did I get squatters?\nI own an 8-unit apartment building that I call the Ocho. I bought this property a couple of years ago and it came with some tenants who were not amazing. One of those tenants had been behind on rent a few times and caused some other issues so we decided not to renew their lease. That tenant said they were planning to move out of state so it worked out for everyone, or so we thought. \nBelow is the actual eviction\n\n\n\n\nWe gave them notice and about 20 days later they said they would be out and would drop off the keys. Those keys never showed up. We called a few times and we got the same story. They were almost done moving out and would have keys to us soon. The keys never showed up and then the story from the tenant changed. They said they were all moved out but their sister was at the house cleaning for a day. She claimed the sister would drop off the keys soon. I knew this story was not going to end well.\nI stopped by the property and talked to the \u201csister\u201d who was at the property. There was also another lady and maybe more people in the apartment and they did not look like they were cleaning. They said they would be out the next day and would drop off the keys. Big surprise they did not show up so I stopped by the apartment again to see what was going on and I got the same story. Luckily we had already posted a stay or quit notice when the first tenant had said they were bringing keys and never did because they never paid rent for the next month after they were supposed to have moved.\nI knew the sister was not going to leave but evictions are expensive and we try to avoid them. I told her I would pay her $200 if she could be out by the end of the week. She agreed and said she would be out and get us the keys. That day came and she said she was out so I stopped by the property. To my surprise, she was out! However, there were at least three new people in the apartment who I had never seen before. \nI was hesitant to talk to them because they did not look like they wanted to talk to me but I really wanted them out. I walked over and one of them came out of the apartment. He claimed to be the ex-boyfriend of the original tenant and said the \u201csister\u201d was his sister and not related to the tenant. He claimed he had moved in because he used to live here with the original tenant and the electric bill was in his name. However, he was never on the lease and we had never seen him or talked to him before. He also showed me a massive cut on his arm he said he got from being stabbed recently but decided he didn\u2019t need to go to the hospital so he taped it shut. \nI told him he couldn\u2019t stay and he needed to leave. He gave me all kinds of stories like he approved to get rent money from COVID funds, he said he talked to my office and they said he could stay, and he said his ex said he could be there. None of these stories checked out. I even called the ex who he claimed told him he could stay and asked her about it. She confirmed no one should be there and one reason she is moving out of state is this guy. Some other people came out of the apartment and said they would start paying rent too and had jobs but they hadn\u2019t been paid yet. Even if they had money, I would never take it as that could constitute a lease!\nIt was clear they were not going to leave. Unfortunately, while I was talking to them the server for the eviction came by and posted the notice that said they had another ten days until the court date for the eviction. They all thought that meant they could stay! I thought about calling the cops and I should have even though they may not have done anything in this situation. Technically they were trespassing but they also had the keys and cops tend to try to stay out of these situations. \nI decided to leave and pursue the eviction since it was coming up. \nThe eviction hearing\nI always use an attorney to handle all of my evictions because I have tried it on my own and I never fill out the paperwork right and it costs me more time and money than an attorney would have cost me. I let my attorney take care of it and waited for him to tell me when the eviction date would be. I got a call from the attorney and he said the eviction was not granted! I could not believe it. He said the squatters showed up to the hearing which was a Zoom call because of covid and the judge granted them a 30-day extension because \u201cthey had nowhere to go\u201d. \nLooking back on this I should have gone to the hearing. I do not know if it would have helped but I could have told the story and what happened and maybe the judge would not have made that decision. As it was, I now had to wait 30 days or hope they moved out which they were not going to do. I drove by all the time and saw more people in and around the unit. I wanted them out so bad, not just because I feared they were destroying the place but because of the other tenants in the building as well. \nAnother eviction hearing\nI showed up to the next hearing and my attorney and I waited for the judge who hopped on the Zoom call about 10 minutes late. The squatters were not on the call. The judge made us wait another 15 minutes for them to show and he seemed disappointed that they never did. He finally ruled the eviction would proceed since they did not show up. We finally got the eviction scheduled with the sheriff for three weeks out. \nTime drug on for what seemed like forever and the eviction day finally came. I showed up with my crew because Colorado requires ten people to be there so they can move everything out in an hour. The sheriff\u2019s deputies serve the notice and make sure everyone is safe. I know the deputies and they are really cool. I could not tell if the squatters were still there but I would think they wouldn\u2019t be because I was guessing they didn\u2019t want any contact with law enforcement. \nI was wrong! They were still there and it took them 15 minutes to answer the door. The deputies talked to them and they had not moved anything out. We all decided to give them 10 minutes to move what they could and then we would move the rest. I got in the property and it was dirty but thankfully not destroyed. The tenants moved their stuff into their car and left. I never saw them again. The rest of the stuff we left in the yard for 24 hours per Colorado law and disposed of after that.\nThis could have been much worse based on what I see in other states but it was still frustrating waiting months for the eviction and not getting any rent. \nAnother squatter eviction we did:\n\n\n\nHow to get squatters out\nThere are a few things I could have done better and some things others can do to avoid long squatter situations as well.\n\nIf you have vacant properties check on them often! A vacant property is a target for squatters and vandalism. \nIf you see someone on your property who should not be there call the police immediately. The police may or may not do anything but you still need to try. Some squatters may not want police contact and may leave if they come. The police may say it\u2019s a civil matter or not their problem but remind them it is trespassing and illegal. If you let squatters stay too long without reporting them it makes it much more difficult to get rid of them.\nIf there are squatters with no lease, create a document stating the people in the property have no lease and no permission to be in the property. Get this statement notarized and bring it with a copy of the Deed showing the true owner does not have any lease with the squatters in case the squatters provide a fake lease. \nIf you think something fishy is going on with your tenants, schedule an inspection. Most leases should have a clause that the landlord can inspect the property with notice. If they won\u2019t let you in, that could be grounds for eviction. \nIf tenants are not paying or are supposed to leave and not leaving, start the eviction process as soon as possible. \nIn extreme situations, you can try offering cash for keys, or money for them to move. Never pay them before they are out and give you the keys. \nBe careful accepting any money or rent as that could give them legal grounds to stay even if they do not have a formal lease. \nIf an eviction hearing is scheduled it doesn\u2019t hurt to show up yourself to give insight into the situation. Just don\u2019t lose your cool or make it worse.\nDon\u2019t do anything illegal like bring enforcers to physically remove people. Talk to an attorney and check state laws to make sure you don\u2019t give the judge or squatters a reason to stay.\nIf you are in a really tricky situation with state laws and police who will not help, turn to social media or neighbors.  Tell your story and the more attention you get, the more likely you can get your situation resolved. Again, stay within the law, stay calm, and don\u2019t make it worse. \nBe careful about rekeying properties or trying to force them out on your own. \n\nConclusion\nA lot of people think that because they own the property they can do whatever they want, however, that is not the case. When you rent to someone or give them permission to be in the property they have gained rights to that property. If they live there they are in possession of the property and you cannot simply force them to move or rekey the property. Be sure to talk to a lawyer and check with state laws when you encounter a situation like this. Each state has different laws and eviction processes so just because you see someone else do it, doesn\u2019t make it legal. I hope you never have to encounter a situation like this but if you do act fast and don\u2019t give up! \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\nAdd Your CommentCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

These people invest their own capital directly in your project, secured by the property itself. \nSaid another way, private money usually means borrowing from a person who is looking to earn interest on their cash. For taking a risk on you and your project, they get some form of recourse, which may include getting the title to your property if you don\u2019t pay the loan back according to the terms of the agreement.\nHere\u2019s what real estate investors get with private money:\n\nFaster closing times:\u00a0No red tape,\u00a0which expedites deal execution.\nFlexible criteria:\u00a0Less rigid evaluation and underwriting,\u00a0catering to scenarios banks might reject.\nCustom terms:\u00a0Negotiate interest rates,\u00a0loan amounts,\u00a0and repayment structures directly.\n\nPrivate money loans are different than hard money loans.

Real estate has changed over the years but I still love it and still invest today. Over the years, I have learned many things and evolved from trying to rent and screen tenants based on gut feelings to developing systems that work much better! \nBeing a landlord can be rewarding, but navigating the world of rentals also comes with its share of challenges. To be successful and avoid unnecessary headaches, it\u2019s crucial to avoid these common pitfalls.\nTable of Contents \u2013 Top 5 Mistakes Landlords Make1. Skipping Thorough Tenant Screening2. Neglecting the Lease Agreement3. Ignoring Maintenance Issues4. Setting Unrealistic Rent Prices5. Failing to Communicate EffectivelyConclusion\n1. Skipping Thorough Tenant Screening\nRushing to fill a vacancy almost always backfires. A proper screening process, including checking references, credit reports, and employment history, helps identify responsible tenants who are likely to pay rent on time and respect your property. Gut feelings are not the best way to choose tenants, even if they are friends or family, especially if they are friends or family! Don\u2019t rush to rent a place to the first people who apply because you don\u2019t have the time. If you don\u2019t have the time, you should not be the one leasing the property.  \n\nI use DoorLoop for all of my tenant applications and screening. It makes managing background checks very easy. \nYou can read more about how I screen for tenants.\n2. Neglecting the Lease Agreement\nA clear, detailed lease agreement is what protects you when a dispute arises, including evictions. If you don\u2019t have a lease or the right lease, it can make eviction take much longer and cost much more money. We try to avoid evictions but that is not always possible even with proper screening. \nIt must outline expectations, responsibilities, and procedures for rent payment, repairs, maintenance, and dispute resolution. Vague agreements lead to confusion and potential legal issues. \nEither get a lease from a local attorney or use a high-quality online legal document generation tool. I use Legaltemplates.com. Using a local real estate attorney will be helpful in case a dispute arises later. \nSee my tips for the best ways to manage rental properties.\n3. Ignoring Maintenance Issues\nIgnoring leaky faucets, malfunctioning appliances, or minor repairs can snowball into bigger problems down the line. Prompt maintenance not only keeps tenants happy but also prevents costly damage and potential legal action. You cannot rely on your tenants to tell you about every issue. It is also important to schedule regular inspections to see if there are any major issues in the property and that the tenants are taking care of it. \nSee my article on how to find contractors for house flips and rentals.\n4. Setting Unrealistic Rent Prices\nOverpricing your property can lead to long vacancies and lost income. Research fair market rents in your area and consider factors like amenities, location, and condition before setting a price. Remember that asking price for other rentals is not always the best way to gauge market value. Those properties could be for rent for months and overpriced. Pay attention to the market to see which ones are being rented and which ones are sitting. \nZillow provides fairly accurate rent estimates (rent is easier to estimate than value). \nOnce you have an idea of market rent, you can use my Rental Property Cash Flow Calculator to understand your financials.\n5. Failing to Communicate Effectively\nCommunication is key to a healthy landlord-tenant relationship. Be professional, responsive, and address concerns promptly. Ignoring tenant issues or being dismissive can create frustration and escalate into bigger problems. Ignoring tenants can also get you in trouble with the city or county where you reside. \nI don\u2019t personally deal directly with issues. I instead chose a great property manager to ensure communication is open and issues are handled promptly. They typically charge a percentage fee, which I simply build into my expenses.\nRead my article on how to find a great property manager.\nConclusion\nBy avoiding these common mistakes, you can create a positive rental experience for both yourself and your tenants, leading to a smoother, more profitable investment. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\nAdd Your CommentCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

I have learned a lot about what helps houses sell and what does not. I have also learned what to spend money on and what not to. If you plan to sell your house, and you want to get the most money you can, you need to make it look as appealing as possible without breaking your budget. \nTable of ContentsHow important is curb appeal? Decluttering and staging a homeWhat repairs should you make when selling?Price the home right and be easy to work withWhen should you sell the home?Conclusion\nHow important is curb appeal? \nFirst impressions matter but they may not matter as much as many people think. When we watch HGTV all we hear about is curb appeal. I think curb appeal is mentioned so much because it is an easy catchphrase to remember and it is easy to see the differences on TV. TV is not always reality. \nWhen I sell houses I want the property to look good on the outside but I do not need to spend tens of thousands of dollars installing custom landscaping. if the yard is dead on a house we are flipping we won\u2019t install sod and then sprinklers because we will never get that money back. Now if you live in the home and can nurse a yard back to health with little money definitely do that. \n\nWe will add mulch, trim or remove dead trees, repair fences, etc, but we usually aren\u2019t adding fences or adding trees. If the house needs paint we will of course paint it, especially if there is peeling paint as that can stop a buyer from getting financing. The reason we don\u2019t do a lot of yard work is that most buyers feel they can do that work themselves. It can be hard work but not complicated work. \nDecluttering and staging a home\nMost of the homes we sell are vacant so we do not need to declutter. However, many of you reading this may be living in the home and have your stuff, maybe a lot of stuff in that home. Homes look their best when there are very few personal items in the home and no mess. It might sound weird, but leaving pictures up distracts buyers. It distracts me. I see them and I think do I know them, have we met, how many kids do they have, when I should be looking at the house! This is for a seasoned investor! Take down all the personal photos and remove as much clutter as you can. Make sure the home is as clean as possible and smells good!\nIf the house is vacant we sometimes stage it and sometimes don\u2019t. It depends on the size of the home, the market, the feel of the home, and many other factors. When we do stage, we hire a company to add furniture and a few decorations. The worst thing you can do is add one table and chair with a bottle of wine. If you are going to stage, do it right. If you don\u2019t want to stage that is fine but don\u2019t make it obvious you wanted to stage but got tired and quit. \n\n\n\nWhat repairs should you make when selling?\nI can write an entire article on repairs and have done that because a lot can be said. I also have videos that I will link to after this section because repairs are tricky. The two biggest questions to ask when thinking about what to repair and what not to are can the buyers get financing and does the house look good? \nFor FHA to finance a home, it needs to be in livable condition which means the roof is decent, the windows aren\u2019t broken, the major systems work, there is no peeling paint, and there are no safety hazards. Some people may say well we will just sell to a buyer not using FHA. Except, most owner-occupied loans will use the same guidelines as FHA. If you want to sell to an investor you will most likely get much less money than selling to an owner-occupant. if you need help figuring out what repairs to make for financing talk to a local agent or check this out. \nOnce the house qualifies for financing you need to make sure it looks and feels good. Cosmetic repairs go a long way like paint and flooring. You do not need to go crazy spending $100k on kitchen and bath upgrades. Stick to the affordable repairs if your budget allows it and if the home is in decent shape you might not need to make any repairs. \n\n\n\nPrice the home right and be easy to work with\nIf you price your home too high, it doesn\u2019t matter how good it looks or feels. Pricing is the most important part of selling a home and you need to get it right from the start. If you price too high and lower it over time, you will most likely get less than pricing it right the first time. Again, I would use an agent to help you figure out what to price it at based on the condition of the home. \nIt is also important to be easy to work with. If you need 48 hours for a showing, that will deter many buyers. Have the home ready to show at all times and be ready to get out of there or let it be shown if you are at work. You may want 2 weeks after closing to move out but that will deter many buyers as well. be very clear about what stays with the home and what you are taking as far as appliances or other items that may be attached to the property. \nIf you get an offer remember you are not fighting the buyers or trying to win, you are working with them to come up with a win/win scenario. \nWhen should you sell the home?\nMany people say you should always sell in the spring because that is when most buyers are looking. That is true but that is also when most sellers are selling as well. If you are ready to sell your home, I would not wait for the perfect time although I would avoid a few times of the year if possible. Fall is usually the slowest time of the year because kids are going back to school and everyone is super busy. The Holidays are also tough because people are distracted and busy. Most any other time of the year works and buyers are always looking. \nConclusion\nSelling a house is not rocket science but many things that go into it. Getting your house prepared to sell can net you tens of thousands of dollars more than simply listing it and hoping. It is easier than ever to sell by owner now with online marketing tools and social media but I would always use an agent personally. Yes, I am an agent but even buying or selling out of state where I am not licensed I always use an agent. They can help you price the home right, and give you ideas on staging and repairs, they also handle the showings and will expose the property to more buyers. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\nAdd Your CommentCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

In this post, I\u2019ll cover the top 5 real estate investment terms that are essential for every investor\u2019s toolkit. From cash flow to leverage, these terms form the bedrock of successful investing. I think it is also important to know the right meaning for these terms and many people stretch the meanings or completely change them!\nSo, let\u2019s dive in and equip ourselves with the knowledge that will shape our journey towards financial prosperity.\n1. Cash Flow \u2013 The Foundation of Financial Success \nLet\u2019s start with a term close to every investor\u2019s heart \u2013 cash flow. Beyond the straightforward inflow and outflow of funds, it serves as the cornerstone of financial success in real estate. It is one of the primary metrics I use to make purchase decisions. I also look at how good the deal is and how much value I can add. \n\nMany people will tell you that cash flow is simply the rent minus the mortgage and insurance. However, if you want to know the true cash flow you will need to know all of your expenses. Here is an example of what true cash flow looks like:\n\nRent: $2,000\nMortgage: $1,100\nTaxes: $200\nInsurance: $200\nHoa: $50\nVacancies: $100\nMaintenance: $200\nProperty management: $180\n\nOne investor might tell you the cash flow is $500 a month but they are leaving out many of the expenses the property will incur over time. The true cash flow would be -$30! \nDetermining cash flow requires a variety of calculations, so I\u2019ve created a calculator to help you out: InvestFourMore Cash Flow Calculator\n2. Cap Rate \u2013 A Metric for Strategic Decision-Making \nCap rate, a metric mostly used on commercial properties and multifamily housing gives an idea of what the property will make without financing and what the property is worth based on the NOI or net operating income. The basic formula is:\nnet income / price = cap rate\nThe Cap Rate formula may seem simple enough but it can be manipulated very easily. Investors may not include all the expenses in the NOI or they may use projected income instead of actual income. Never take these numbers as absolute without digging into them. \nYou can use my calculator here: InvestFourMore Cap Rate Calculator\n3. ROI \u2013 Evaluating Investment Performance \nReturn on Investment (ROI) serves as the scorecard for your property\u2019s performance. As a pair to cash flow, ROI helps you determine what the property will make based on many factors like loan pay down, appreciation, and value add. Cash flow looks at what the property makes on a monthly basis and ROI looks at the big picture. \nROI is not easy to figure because some years may have a huge increase in value thanks to adding tenants or making repairs while other years may have much more modest returns. You would figure ROI on an annual basis and may want to separate out first-year ROI from the later years\u2019 ROI because of those jumps in value. \nBelow is a video of a value-added play I invested in recently. \n\n\n\n4. Leverage \u2013 Maximizing Potential While Mitigating Risks \nLeverage is the prime weapon of real estate investors if you are looking to scale quickly. With leverage, you only invest a fraction of the total purchase price, which can cause your returns to be significantly higher than investing in something like stocks. To achieve leverage, you use financing. Financing is one of the most important aspects of investing in real estate. You can make more money with\u00a0loans than by paying cash.\nOn this site, I talk about the many different, creative ways you can finance real estate investments.\n5. Equity \u2013 The Silent Wealth Builder \nEquity, an often-underestimated force in wealth accumulation, goes beyond property values, embodying true ownership. \nequity = current market value - amount financed\nEquity can be built slowly through market appreciation and loan pay down. You can also build equity by adding value and getting great deals on properties. I prefer to use both! Many people may say equity does not matter because it is not cash in hand, but it can become cash in hand by using a cash-out refinance, or selling. You can even use a 1031 exchange to sell and not pay taxes on the profit. \nThanks to leverage and equity, my net worth has skyrocketed to over $10 million just from real estate. \nWhat\u2019s the best way to invest in real estate?\nEven better, you can use equity and leverage together to purchase additional properties and scale up your business using the BRRRR method.\nConclusion\nThis primer serves as a solid foundation for fundamental real estate investment terms. As you navigate real estate, I invite you to explore the extensive resources on InvestFourMore, where a wealth of data-driven insights and strategies await. \nFeel free to engage with the community, sharing your experiences or seeking guidance.

Real estate investors also provide rentals which are the next step from homelessness as most people in a dire housing situation are not able to buy for various reasons. Here are some key ways real estate investors can contribute to preventing homelessness:\nDid landlords cause real estate prices to increase?\nThere is a growing trend stating that landlords are not needed and the world would be better off without them. This stance is backed up by many statements that tend to be grossly exaggerated or simply false. I am a landlord and of course, I am biased but I have been an investor, agent, author, and influencer in the real estate space for 20 years. I have seen what happens in the real world and know a thing or two about real estate. Many of the opinions about landlords and real estate investors stem from Facebook pages, politicians, or even educators who have zero experience with real estate. \nLandlords do not push up prices because they are buying all the houses. In fact, the owner-occupied rate has increased from 62 percent to 66 percent from 2016 to 2023. There are 11 million more owner-occupied units in 2023 compared to 2016 and about the same amount of rental units. The truth is real estate investors have been selling much more than buying. \n\nRents have been rising because there are fewer rentals available due to landlords selling. That is simple supply and demand. Some people claim landlords buying all the houses is causing rents to go up, but that is the opposite of what happens in the economy when supply increases. The real cause of prices going up is the cost to build, replacement costs, and development costs. \n\n\n\nHow are landlords needed?\nSome hypothesize that if landlords were eliminated (yes some advocate violence) housing would be more affordable and more people could buy. The problem with this theory is that not everyone can or wants to buy. Some people have bad credit or no job history which prevents them from getting a loan. Some want to travel or simply don\u2019t want to buy a house. The theory that all landlords should disappear ignores these people and just assumes they will magically be able to buy a house because prices will be cheaper without landlords. \nThe theory that housing will be cheaper without landlords comes from the idea that a bunch of housing will be available to buy. However, that housing has occupants and renters living in the homes. There will not be a lot of housing to buy unless you kick those renters out. Sure some renters may be able to buy the house they are currently living in but there still won\u2019t be a massive influx of supply unless there are millions of homeless renters. These theories also assume everyone will get a loan after the laws are all changed eliminating credit and other loan requirements. We saw what happened with loosened lending guidelines in 2008. \nWithout landlords, there will be massive amounts of homeless because the step from homelessness to housing is a rental not buying. Some people might say more social housing is needed. I can see that argument but landlords are not stopping more social housing from being created, in fact, they help create the social housing that exists. \nHow do landlords prevent homelessness?\nThe United States has many programs for those in need including Section 8 housing vouchers, local city and state programs, and affordable housing grants and tax benefits. Most social housing is not built or run by the government, it is run by investors. The government encourages affordable housing projects to be built and redeveloped but they are not the ones doing the work. It is real estate investors who build and create these properties. The US is not alone in this either. Many people point to Austria as having massive social housing programs. They fail to realize that private investors own most of that social housing. Section 8 vouchers are used on properties owned by investors, not the government. \nHouse flippers also buy properties that are unlivable and make them livable again creating more houses which helps reduce homelessness and increases the housing supply as well. I have brought many single-family and multifamily properties up to livable standards after buying them vacant. Do I make money when I do this? Hopefully! If investors do not take on these projects, no one will and there will be less housing and more expensive housing because of supply and demand principles. \nReal estate investors also build housing. They build apartments and even single-family homes. Do these turn into rentals? Yes, but that still adds inventory to the market which means more choices for buyers or renters. More inventory means a more stable housing market and fewer opportunities for out-of-control price increases. \n\n\n\nShould real estate investors be restricted on what they can buy or build?\nThere are many people, including people in the real estate industry who feel real estate investors should be restricted on what they can buy or build. The government is trying to restrict investors from buying properties as well. Many of these programs are aimed at huge institutional investors but they are a tiny part of the real estate market. They own less than 1 percent of housing. \nAs I stated before there is a shortage of rentals on the market. That is why rents have been increasing so much. \nOwner occupied vs rental units \nThe best way to increase rents and increase housing prices is to limit supply which is exactly what more restrictions on investors will do. The most expensive markets in the country have the most restrictions. Many large institutional investors are building houses as well when we desperately need more houses to be built! I can\u2019t believe some of the people saying this is bad and must be stopped. \nConclusion\nWithout real estate investors there would be less housing, more homelessness, higher prices, and pretty much a disaster. Investors create affordable housing and putting more restrictions on them will discourage them from doing so and create less affordable housing. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\nAdd Your CommentCancel reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

However, the United States does not have any national building codes the states or local cities make their own rules. I have found the states or areas with the strictest building codes also have the highest prices. The harder it is to build or repair homes, the more expensive they become because people stop building, and when they do build, they have to raise the price for it to make sense. So what areas have the strictest building codes in the US?\nHow do building codes change over time?\n100 years ago there were basically no building codes. Anyone could build whatever they wanted, wherever they wanted with some minor restrictions. Over time, the government decided that houses and commercial properties were not safe enough and there needed to be standards set for construction and even repairs. Some cities, states, and counties choose to have stricter codes than others and the federal government has let local governments make those decisions. \nYou can see how building codes have changed over time by looking at houses built in different eras. 100 years ago some houses were built with amazing carpentry and we often hear \u201cthey don\u2019t build them like they used to\u201d. There were also many houses that were built like shacks that have since fallen down. I have bought many of those shacks as a real estate investor and am surprised many of those houses lasted as long as they did. \n\nYou can see improvements in houses by looking at houses from different eras. Houses that are 100 years old may not have any windows in the basement where egress windows are now required. Houses from 50 years ago had very little insulation whereas houses now are required to have a minimum amount. You used to be able to put three layers of shingles on a roof and now most areas only allow one. Areas close to the coast may require hurricane glass and reinforced structures. \nThe stricter building codes make houses safer and more energy efficient but they also make them more expensive. \n\n\n\nWhat areas do not have building codes?\nBelieve it or not, there are still some areas in the US that do not have building codes! These states do not have building codes:\n\nAlabama\nArizona\nColorado\nIllinois\nMississippi\nMissouri\nNorth Dakota\nTennessee\nTexas\nWest Virginia\nWyoming\n\nWhile these states do not have standard building codes, the local cities and counties usually do. I live in Colorado and while there is no standard building code for the entire state, Denver and Boulder have some of the strictest building codes in the nation. Louisville, where the Marshall Fires occurred in 2021 requires fire sprinkler systems in all new houses although they did remove that requirement for houses destroyed in the fire! \nHere are some counties without building codes (from https://offgridgrandpa.com/states-and-counties-with-no-building-codes/):\n\nDelta County in Colorado\nMontezuma County in Colorado\nArcosanti Urban Laboratory in Arizona\nBrewster County in Texas\nWonder Valley in California\nMarfa County in Texas\nTerlingua Texas\nMiller County Missouri\n\nIn these areas, you might be able to get away with building whatever you want as long as you are not in a city with more strict codes but remember codes can always change!\nDo you need to get building permits?\nWhat areas have the strictest building codes?\nI found it interesting but not surprising that the areas with the strictest building codes tend to have the highest prices. When you look at the list below the most strict areas are definitely the most expensive as well. \n1. San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA 1.18 18\n2. New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA 1.04 57\n3.

It is not real estate investors that push up prices as many people claim, it is the government. The harder it is to build and repair houses, the more expensive they are going to be when they are built. The harder it is to build houses, the fewer houses that will be built which will also cause an imbalance in the housing market driving prices up even further. You will also find fewer investors in these areas because it is hard to build, expensive to own, and a pain to do business in those areas. \nConclusion\nBuilding codes do make houses safe and more energy efficient but they also make houses more expensive at a time when houses are becoming less and less affordable. If you are pushing for stricter building codes and more energy-efficient homes, you are also pushing for higher prices. While homes in the US seem to be out of range for many people thanks to high-interest rates, remember the US actually has the 5th most affordable housing in the world. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOne thought on \u201cWhat Areas in the US have the strictest building codes?\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n lunarealtybelize says: \n\nOctober 17, 2023 at 1:09 pm \n\n\ncovers it all with meticulous research and attention to detail.

People need places to live whether they are rentals or personal houses and higher rates make those properties much more expensive unless someone is paying cash. While higher rates make it tougher to buy real estate that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be buying. It is extremely hard to time markets and usually, the best time to buy is when the time is right for you. A lot of people predicted a real estate crash which has not happened and I don\u2019t expect one to either. There simply are not enough houses and high rates are making that problem worse not better. \nHave high rates caused property values to decline?\nThere are some potential benefits to investing in real estate during a time of high-interest rates. For example, lower demand could lead to lower prices for certain properties, which could make them more affordable for investors. Additionally, rising interest rates usually indicate higher inflation which could mean rents rise faster than in a normal market. There is, however, no guarantee that either of these things happen. \nWe have seen prices drop in some markets like Austin but overall prices are higher now than ever before. High rates do not cause prices to drop significantly because while they lower the demand for real estate, they also lower the supply. People do not want to lose their low rate and builders slow down construction. I have personally seen lower prices on multifamily properties which is most likely caused by higher rates. There could be a few more deals available in that sector. \n\nHigh rates will most likely make real estate more expensive in the long term because it decreases building. The fewer building there is, the less inventory there is, and eventually, that will catch up to us with higher prices. I would not bet on prices to decrease in the future, especially long term. \n\n\n\nShould you invest when interest rates are high or wait?\nI think there are many more important things to consider when investing in real estate than how high rates are. Yes, they are important but not the most important thing. After all, investors have been investing in high-rate environments for decades and making money prior to 2000. \nHere are some things to consider when deciding whether to invest in real estate when interest rates are high:\n\nDoes the property make money? Just because rates are higher, doesn\u2019t mean that properties can\u2019t make money. There could be markets or deals where a property cash flows even with higher rates. \nWhat kind of investment are you looking for? If you are doing a live-in flip or house hack it still might make sense to buy now since you have to pay for a place to live in whether you rent or buy. \nCan you get a great deal? I get great deals on every property I buy and I would miss out on many deals if I stopped investing because rates are high. Often a great deal will make you much more money than the increased lending costs high rates cause. \nDo you have the cash to wait out high rates? You might be able to get great deals that don\u2019t cash flow now, but will in the future when rents increase or rates drop. If you are financially able to handle an asset that doesn\u2019t make much money or even loses money for a year or two it still might be worth it to buy now. \nAre you flipping or holding? If you are flipping houses the high rates may not impact you as much as landlords holding property. There is still enough demand to sell houses and flippers can continue to buy and sell. \n\nWill rates go down allowing a refinance?\nI believe that eventually, rates will decrease which could allow investors to refinance their loans and reduce their rates significantly. This could turn a money loser into a money maker or turn a single into a home run. I would not bet everything you have on rates going down but it is likely at some point. The big question is when will they go down and how much will they decrease? \nNo one knows the answer to either of those questions but inflation has been decreasing and the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates soon. If rates stay high it will most likely push real estate prices even higher but if they lower rates quickly it could lead to a buyer frenzy and big increases in prices. There are not too many scenarios where I see prices dropping in the long term. \nConclusion\nIf you can get good deals that cash flow there is no reason not to be investing in real estate right now. If you can find good deals or cannot find properties that make money then it may not make sense to invest in this market. But remember, the market may not be getting investor-friendly any time soon. If you are buying as an owner occupant, it usually makes sens to buy whenever the time is right for you and not the when the market is perfect. \n\n\n\n\nShare this post: \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Whatsapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t2 thoughts on \u201cShould you invest in real estate when interest rates are high?\u201d\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n PS Group says: \n\nOctober 25, 2023 at 1:21 am \n\n\nVery useful advice!
